OGLE Galactic Bulge periodic variables (Udalski+ 1996)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars in the Galactic Bulge. The Catalog is based on observations collected during the OGLE (Optical Graviational Lensing Experiment) microlensing search: (1) 213 periodic variable stars brighter than Imag=18mag: 31 pulsating, 116 eclipsing and 66 miscellaneous type variables from the Baade&quot;s Window BWC field are presented. (2) 800 variable stars found in four Baade&quot;s Window fields BW1, BW2, BW3 and BW4 are presented. Among them 71 are classified as pulsating, 465 as eclipsing and 264 as miscellaneous type. (3) 644 variable stars: 64 pulsating, 352 eclipsing and 228 miscellaneous type were detected in four Baade&quot;s Window fields BW5, BW6, BW7 and BW8. Analysis of periodic variable stars found in overlapping regions of the Baade&quot;s Window fields yields an average completeness of the Catalog equal to about 80% of periodic variables objects registered in the OGLE databases and about 65% of all periodic variable stars in the observed region of the sky. (4) 631 variable stars: 59 pulsating, 348 eclipsing and 224 miscellaneous type were detected in third Baade&quot;s Window fields BW9, BW10, and BW11. (5) 574 variables stars: 44 pulsating, 369 eclipsing and 161 miscellaneous type were detected in four fields located symmetrically in the galactic latitude around the Galactic center: MM5-A, MM5-B, MM7-A and MM7-B.</TD>

We serendipitously discovered J0454 in deep Subaru/Suprime-Cam images of MS0451. Images were taken in nine different nights during six periods between 2001-01-22 and 2006-12-21 (PIs: H. Ebeling, N. Yasuda, G. Kosugi). We complemented the BVRIz Subaru/Suprime-Cam data with u*griz CFHT/Megaprime images, which improves the photometric redshifts as a result of the presence of u*-band.</TD>

BVI photometry of OGLE SMC Cepheids (Udalski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of Cepheids from the SMC which contains data for 2049 objects detected in the 2.4 square degree area of central parts of the SMC. For each object period, BVI photometry, astrometry, and R_21_, {phi}_21_ parameters of the Fourier decomposition of I-band light curve are provided. The Catalog is based on observations collected during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. Tests of completeness performed in overlapping parts of adjacent fields indicate that completeness of the Catalog is very high: approx 92%. Statistics and distributions of basic parameters of Cepheids are also presented. All presented data, including individual BVI observations (approx 4.7*10^5^ BVI measurements), are available from the OGLE Internet archive at URL: ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/var_stars/smc/cep/catalog</TD>

SHELS galaxies with 0.02&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.1 (Geller+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Targets for the follow-up spectroscopic program were selected from the catalog
of 8889 bright M dwarfs of Lepine &amp;&amp; Gaidos (2011, cat. J/AJ/142/138).
All stars are selected from the SUPERBLINK catalog of stars (Lepine &amp;&amp;
Shara, 2005, cat. I/298) with proper motions {mu}&amp;gt;40mas/yr. Of the 1564
M dwarf candidates, we found that 286 had been observed at the MDM observatory
by one of us (SL) prior to 2008 November, as part of a separate spectroscopic
follow-up survey of very nearby (d&amp;lt;20pc) stars (Alpert &amp;&amp; Lepine, 2011AAS...21724211A). The remaining targets were distributed between our observing teams at the MDM Observatory and University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope (UH22), with the MDM team in charge of higher declination targets ({delta}&amp;gt;30) and the UH22 team in charge of the lower declination range (0&amp;lt;{delta}&amp;lt;30). Spectra were collected at the MDM observatory in a series of 22 observing runs scheduled between 2002 June and 2012 April. Most of the spectra were collected at the McGraw-Hill 1.3m telescope, but a number were obtained at the neighboring Hiltner 2.4m telescope. Two different spectrographs were used: the MkIII spectrograph, and the CCDS spectrograph.  Both are facility instruments which provide low- to medium-resolution spectroscopy in the optical regime. Their operation at either 1.3m or 2.4m telescopes is identical. Data were collected in slit spectroscopy mode, with an effective slit width of 1.0&amp; to 1.5&amp;

Spectroscopy of bright M dwarfs in the northern sky (Lepine+, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
Targets for the follow-up spectroscopic program were selected from the catalog of 8889 bright M dwarfs of Lepine &amp;amp; Gaidos (2011, cat. J/AJ/142/138). All stars are selected from the SUPERBLINK catalog of stars (Lepine &amp;amp; Shara, 2005, cat. I/298) with proper motions {mu}&amp;gt;40mas/yr. Of the 1564 M dwarf candidates, we found that 286 had been observed at the MDM observatory by one of us (SL) prior to 2008 November, as part of a separate spectroscopic follow-up survey of very nearby (d&amp;lt;20pc) stars (Alpert &amp;amp; Lepine, 2011AAS...21724211A). The remaining targets were distributed between our observing teams at the MDM Observatory and University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope (UH22), with the MDM team in charge of higher declination targets ({delta}&amp;gt;30) and the UH22 team in charge of the lower declination range (0&amp;lt;{delta}&amp;lt;30). Spectra were collected at the MDM observatory in a series of 22 observing runs scheduled between 2002 June and 2012 April. Most of the spectra were collected at the McGraw-Hill 1.3m telescope, but a number were obtained at the neighboring Hiltner 2.4m telescope. Two different spectrographs were used: the MkIII spectrograph, and the CCDS spectrograph. Both are facility instruments which provide low- to medium-resolution spectroscopy in the optical regime. Their operation at either 1.3m or 2.4m telescopes is identical. Data were collected in slit spectroscopy mode, with an effective slit width of 1.0&dquot; to 1.5&dquot;. The MkIII spectrograph was used with two different gratings: the 300l/mm grating blazed at 8000{AA}, providing a spectral resolution R~2000, and the 600l/mm grating blazed at 5800{AA}, which provides R~4000. The two gratings were used with either one of two thick-chip CCD cameras (Wilbur and Nellie) both having negligible fringing in the red. Spectra for a total of 901 bright M dwarf targets were collected at MDM. Additional spectra were obtained with the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope on Mauna Kea between 2009 February anCDS</TD>

OGLE: Gaia South Ecliptic Pole Field (Soszynski+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Gaia South Ecliptic Pole (GSEP) field, 5.3 square degrees area around the South Ecliptic Pole on the outskirts of the LMC, based on the data collected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, OGLE-IV. The GSEP field will be observed during the commissioning phase of the ESA Gaia space mission for testing and calibrating the Gaia instruments. We provide the photometric maps of the GSEP region containing the mean VI photometry of all detected stellar objects and their equatorial coordinates. We show the quality and completeness of the OGLE-IV photometry and color-magnitude diagrams of this region. We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing variables. Several objects deserving special attention were also selected, including a new classical Cepheid in a binary eclipsing system.</TD>

BVI photometry of OGLE LMC Cepheids (Udalski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of Cepheids from the LMC. The Catalog contains 1333 objects detected in the 4.5 square degree area of central parts of the LMC. About 3.4*10^5^ BVI measurements of these stars were collected during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Catalog data include period, BVI photometry, astrometry, and R_21_, phi_21_ parameters of the Fourier decomposition of I-band light curve. The vast majority of objects from the Catalog are the classical Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode. The remaining objects include Population II Cepheids and red giants with pulsation-like light curves. Tests of completeness performed in overlapping parts of adjacent fields indicate that completeness of the Catalog is very high: &amp;gt;96%. Statistics and distributions of basic parameters of Cepheids are also presented. Finally, we show the light curves of three eclipsing systems containing Cepheid detected among objects of the Catalog. All presented data, including individual BVI observations are available from the OGLE Internet archive at URL: ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/var_stars/lmc/cep/catalog/</TD>

BVR photometry of MS0302+17 (Gavazzi+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
We report the sample of galaxies we used for the MS0302+17 photometric and weak lensing analysis, observed on October 12, 1999 with the CFH12K camera mounted at the prime focus of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. In the same file, we report background lensed galaxies, supercluster and foreground early-types galaxies. Stars are also presented. When unknown, fields are assigned an arbitrary value of -99.00. The AB photometry is for CFH12k filters. The R image is much deeper. So we detected more objects with sometimes no B or V reliable counter-part. Coordinates are in J2000. We introduce a flag in order to identify the type. Lenses (either supercluster members (flag=2) or foreground(flag=3)) do not contribute to the lensing signal and we do not report ellipticity components whereas for background galaxies (flag=1), we report (e1,e2) components with the corresponding uncertainty. They are corrected from PSF smearing using standard KSB method. We also report stars (flag=4) that have been used for PSF smearing correction. In this case, we report (e1,e2) ellipticity components before and after psf-correction. Unused objects (that may contain spurious detections!!) are reported with flag=0. Use them with caution.</TD>

OGLE UBVI phot. in Baade&quot;s Window (Paczynski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present UBVI photometry for 8530 stars in Baade&quot;s Window obtained during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. Among these are over one thousand red clump giants. 1391 of them have photometry with errors smaller than 0.04, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.20 mag in the I, V, B, and U-band, respectively. We constructed a map of interstellar reddening. The corrected colors of the red clump giants: (U-B)_0_, (B-V)_0_, and (V-I)_0_ are very well correlated, indicating that a single parameter determines the observed spread of their values, reaching almost 2mag in the (U-B)_0_. It seems most likely that heavy element content is the dominant parameter, but it is possible that another parameter: the age (or mass) of a star moves it along the same trajectory in the color-color diagram as the metallicity. The current ambiguity can be resolved with spectral analysis, and our catalog may be useful as a finding list of red clump giants. We point out that these K giants are more suitable for a fair determination of the distribution of metallicity than brighter M giants. We also present a compilation of UBVI data for 308 red clump giants near the Sun, for which Hipparcos parallaxes are more accurate than 10%. Spectral analysis of their metallicity may provide information about the local metallicity distribution as well as the extent to which mass (age) of these stars affects their colors.</TD>

Australia Telescope 20-GHz (AT20G) High-Angular Resolution Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the high-angular-resolution catalog for the Australia Telescope 20-GHz (AT20G) survey, using the high-angular-resolution 6-km antenna data at the baselines of ~4500 m of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The authors have used the data to produce the visibility catalog that separates the compact active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the extended radio sources at the 0.15-arcsecond angular scale, corresponding to the linear size scale of 1 kpc at redshifts higher than 0.7. They find the radio population at 20 GHz to be dominated by compact AGNs constituting 77% of the total sources in the AT20G. In the paper, they introduce the visibility-spectra diagnostic plot, produced using the AT20G cross-matches with lower frequency radio surveys at 1 GHz [the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS: Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693) and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS: Mauch et al. 2003, MNRAS, 342, 1117)], that separates the 20-GHz population into distinct sub-populations of the compact AGNs, the compact steep-spectrum (CSS) sources, the extended AGN-powered sources and extended flat-spectrum sources. The extended flat-spectrum sources include a local thermal emitting population of high-latitude planetary nebulae and also gravitational lens and binary black hole candidates among the AGNs. The authors find a smooth transition in properties between the CSS sources and the AGN populations. The visibility catalog, together with the main AT20G survey, provides an estimate of angular size scales for sources in the AT20G and an estimate of the flux arising from central cores of extended radio sources. The identification of the compact AGNs in the AT20G survey provides high-quality calibrators for high-frequency radio telescope arrays and very large baseline interferometry observations.</TD>

OGLE-II DIA microlensing events (Wozniak+, 2001)</TD>

We present a sample of microlensing events discovered in the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the OGLE-II images collected during three observing seasons, 1997-1999. 4424 light curves pass our criteria on the presence of a brightening episode on top of a constant baseline. Among those, 512 candidate microlensing events were selected visually. We designed an automated procedure, which unambiguously selects up to 237 best events. Including eight candidate events recovered by other means, a total of 520 light curves are presented in this work.</TD>

MACHO Galactic Bulge microlensing events (Thomas+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of 450 relatively high signal-to-noise ratio microlensing events observed by the MACHO collaboration between 1993 and 1999. The events are distributed throughout our fields, and as expected, they show a clear concentration toward the Galactic center. No optical depth is given for this sample, since no blending efficiency calculation has been performed and we find evidence for substantial blending. In a companion paper we give optical depths for the subsample of events on clump giant source stars, where blending is a less significant effect. Several events with sources that may belong to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy are identified. For these events even relatively low dispersion spectra could suffice to classify these events as either consistent with Sagittarius membership or as non-Sagittarius sources. Several unusual events, such as microlensing of periodic variable source stars, binary lens events, and an event showing extended source effects, are identified. We also identify a number of contaminating background events as cataclysmic variable stars.</TD>

The present catalog contains the most numerous, observationally homogeneous sample of contact binaries. It is derived from the OGLE experiment (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment), in the direction of the Galactic Bulge and the Galactic bar. The observations were made with the 1-m Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, over the period 1992 to 1995. The present catalog includes the 1575 newly discovered contact binaries fainter than I=18mag as well as the 1165 brighter contact binaries previously published. It also includes a list of 506 objects with nearly sinusoidal light curves, to ease the comparison and/or distinction between contact binaries with the sinusoidal light curves and pulsating stars.</TD>

Spectra of 13 lensed quasars (Sluse+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Extracted flux calibrated spectra of 13 lensed quasars following the methodology described in Sect. 2.1. of the oaoer. The data were obtained with the FORS spectrograph at VLT in multi-object spectroscopy mode. The typical wavelength coverage is from 4200 to 8200{AA}. The data concern the following objects: HE0047-1756 (HE0047), Q0142-100 (Q0142), SDSSJ0246-0825 (SDSS0246), HE0435-1223 (HE0435), SDSSJ0806+2006 (SDSS0806), FBQ0951+2635 (FBQ0951), BRI0952-0115 (BRI0952), SDSSJ1138+0314 (J1138), J1226-0006 (J1226), SDSSJ1335+0118 (J1335), Q1355-2257 (Q1355), WFI2033-4723 (WFI2033), and HE2149-2745 (HE2149). For each object, we provide the 1D flux calibrated spectrum of the 2 individual images in the slit. In addition, we also provide the 2D reduced spectrum and corresponding 1{sigma} error frame (corresponding files are named &dquot;objectname_data&dquot; and &dquot;objectname_err&dquot;), and the 2D processed spectra associated to the deconvolution, as shown in Fig.1 of the paper. These processed 2D spectra are the deconvolved frame (&dquot;_dec&dquot;), the extended component of the flux emission (&dquot;_ext&dquot;) and the residual frame in {sigma} units (&dquot;_res&dquot;) corresponding to panel (b), (c) and (d) of Fig.1. A pdf file file similar to Fig.1 is also provided for each object.</TD>

OGLE SMC BVI photometry (Udalski+ 1998)</TD>
<TD>
We present three color, BVI maps of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The maps contain precise photometric and astrometric data for about 2.2million stars from the central regions of the SMC bar covering ~2.4 square degrees on the sky. Mean brightness of stars is derived from observations collected in the course of the OGLE-II microlensing search from about 130, 30 and 15 measurements in the I, V and B-bands, respectively. Accuracy of the zero points of photometry is about 0.01mag, and astrometry 0.15arcsec (with possible systematic error up to 0.7arcsec). Color magnitude diagrams of observed fields are also presented. The maps of the SMC are the first from the series of similar maps covering other OGLE fields: LMC, Galactic bulge and Galactic disk. The data are very well suited for many projects, particularly for the SMC which has been neglected photometrically for years.</TD>

NOT GL survey of multiply imaged quasars (Jaunsen+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
A gravitational lens (GL)-search program, initiated in 1990 at the Nordic Optcal Telescope (NOT), has revealed several possible GL-candidates among a sample of 168 quasars (QSOs), chosen from three lists compiled by C. Hazard, D. Reimers and J. Surdej, respectively. Some of these candidates, selected for having close companions (within 5 arcseconds), were imaged in several filters and their colours compared. Low dispersion spectra of the most promising candidates were also obtained at the NOT and ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT). None of these has proved to be strong candidates of gravitational lensing effects. We present this new sample of QSOs and combine it with previously published optical QSO samples in a statistical analysis to yield constraints on flat cosmologies and galaxy velocity dispersions.</TD>

CRATES Flat-Spectrum Radio Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
The authors have assembled an 8.4 GHz survey of bright, flat-spectrum (alpha &amp;gt; -0.5) radio sources with nearly uniform extragalactic (|b| &amp;gt; 10 degrees) coverage for sources brighter than a 4.8 GHz flux density S_4.8GHz = 65 mJy. The catalog is assembled from existing observations (especially the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey, CLASS, and the Wright et al. PMN-CA survey), augmented by reprocessing of archival VLA and ATCA data and by new observations to fill in coverage gaps. The authors refer to this program as CRATES, the Combined Radio All-Sky Targeted Eight-GHz Survey. The resulting catalog provides precise positions, subarcsecond structures, and spectral indices for some 11,000 sources. The authors describe the morphology and spectral index distribution of the sample and comment on the survey&quot;s power to select several classes of interesting sources, especially high-energy blazars. Comparison of CRATES with other high-frequency surveys also provides unique opportunities for identification of high-power radio sources. This table contains 14467 entries, where each entry corresponds to an 8.4-GHz counterpart source (or absence thereof) to one of 11,131 4.8-GHz sources. The number of entries exceeds the number of 4.8-GHz sources because there are many cases in which there are multiple (from 2 - 20) 8.4-GHz counterparts to a single 4.8-GHz source. There are also 762 entries in which no 8.4-GHz counterpart was detected (morph_type = &quot;N&quot;).</TD>

Galaxies of J0454-0309 lensing fossil group (Schirmer+, 2010)</TD>

We serendipitously discovered J0454 in deep Subaru/Suprime-Cam images of MS0451. Images were taken in nine different nights during six periods between 2001-01-22 and 2006-12-21 (PIs: H. Ebeling, N. Yasuda, G. Kosugi). We complemented the BVRIz Subaru/Suprime-Cam data with u*griz CFHT/Megaprime images, which improves the photometric redshifts as a result of the presence of u*-band.</TD>

OGLE variables in Galactic bar (Wray+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
Among over 200000 Galactic bulge variable stars in the public domain Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) catalogue, we found over 15000 red giant variables following two well-defined period-amplitude relations. The periods are in the range 10&amp;lt;P&amp;lt;100d, and amplitudes in the range 0.005&amp;lt;A&amp;lt;0.13mag in the I band. The variables cover a broad range of reddening-corrected colours, 1&amp;lt;(V-I)_0_&amp;lt;5, and a fairly narrow range of extinction-corrected apparent magnitudes, 10.5&amp;lt;I_0_&amp;lt;13. A subset of variables (type A) has an rms scatter of only 0.44mag. The average magnitudes for these stars are well correlated with the Galactic longitude, and vary from I_k,0_=11.82 for l=+8{deg} to I_k,0_=12.07 for l=-5{deg}, clearly indicating that they are located in the Galactic bar. Most variables have several oscillation periods.</TD>

1998-2000 OGLE events microlensing limits (Tsapras+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
The data sets presented here were obtained from the DoPhot analysis of the events available at the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) website, ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/olge . For the purposes of this analysis, we only considered the events for which the point-source point-lens (PSPL) model provided adequate fits. Out of a total of 162 events observed by the OGLE (Udalski, 1994ApJ...436L.103U) collaboration during a three-year period (1998-2000), we found that for 145 of these the reduced {chi}^2^ of the PSPL model fit, adjusting six parameters, approached a value of unity, indicating a good fit.</TD>

Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS) Point Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This study presents the first set of maps and band-merged catalog from the Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS). Observations at 250, 350, and 500 micron (um) were taken with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instrument onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. HerS covers 79 square degrees along the SDSS Stripe 82 to an average depth of 13.0, 12.9, and 14.8 mJy beam&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (including confusion) at 250, 350, and 500 um, respectively. HerS was designed to measure correlations with external tracers of the dark matter density field, either point-like (i.e., galaxies selected from radio to X-ray) or extended (i.e., clusters and gravitational lensing), in order to measure the bias and redshift distribution of intensities of infrared-emitting dusty star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. By locating HerS in Stripe 82, the authors maximize the overlap with available and upcoming cosmological surveys. The band-merged catalog contains 3.3 x 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; sources detected at a significance of &amp;amp;gt;~ 3 sigma (including confusion noise). The maps and catalog are available at &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/&dquot;&amp;gt;http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This table contains the first HerS band-merged point source catalog based on observations covering 79 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; in the equatorial Stripe 82, spanning 13 to 37 degrees (0&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 54&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to 2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 24&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; ) in RA, and -2 to +2 degrees in Declination. The SPIRE beams are 18.1, 25.2 and 36.6 arcseconds at 250, 350 and 500 um, respectively. The band-merged catalog was constructed, after filtering, with DESPHOT (Roseboom et al. 2010, MNRAS, 409, 48), using 250-um sources (extracted with STARFINDER: Diolaiti et al. 2000, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 147, 335) as positional priors. The authors included sources with S/N greater than 3, whose completeness is estimated to be 50% (see Figure 7 of the reference paper), with a false detectiNASA/GSFC HEASARC</TD>

<TD>
ESA&quot;s Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) was used to perform a deep survey with ISOCAM through three massive gravitationally lensing clusters of galaxies. The total area surveyed depends on source flux, with nearly seventy square arcminutes covered for the brighter flux levels in maps centred on the three clusters Abell 370, Abell 2218 and Abell 2390. We present maps and photometry at 6.7um (hereafter 7um) and 14.3um (hereafter 15um), showing a total of 145 mid-infrared sources and the associated source counts.</TD>

BAX is designed to support astronomical research by providing access to published measurements of the main physical quantities and to the related bibliographic references: basic data stored in the database are cluster/group identifiers, equatorial coordinates, redshift, flux, X-ray luminosity (in the ROSAT band) and temperature, and (in the online version at &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&dquot;&amp;gt;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) links to additional linked parameters (in X-rays, such as spatial profile parameters, as well as SZ parameters of the hot gas, lensing measurements, and data at other wavelengths, such as the optical and radio bands). The clusters and groups in the online BAX database can be queried by the basic parameters as well as the linked parameters or combinations of these. The authors expect BAX to become an important tool for the astronomical community. BAX will optimize various aspects of the scientific analysis of X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies, from proposal planning to data collection, interpretation and publication, from both ground based facilities like MEGACAM (CFHT), VIRMOS (VLT) and from space missions like XMM-Newton, Chandra and Planck.</TD>

We present a catalog of secondary photometric standard stars in the neighborhood of 14 gravitationally lensed quasars. These stars were verified to be non variable using long-term monitoring. The instrumental magnitudes of the new standard stars have been transformed to the Johnson-Cousins BV(RI)c photometric system. For ten gravitational lenses (GLs) we also provide the BV(RI)c mean magnitudes of the integrated flux of all the lens components, for the epochs of the photometric calibration.</TD>

Log of Subaru Prime Focus Camera Exposures (ADAC NAOJ, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
This database contains a log of the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) exposures since April 2001. The data are regularly updated, and the last date of the log is written in &dquot;File Summary&dquot;. Note that from this version of Nov. 2005, the data number is largely increased because those data with worse position determination (up to 30 arcsec error) are included. Suprime-Cam is an 80-mega pixels (10240 x 8192) mosaic CCD camera, for the wide-field prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34&quot;x27&quot;, a unique facility among the 8-10m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0&dquot;.202 per pixel. The focal plane consists of ten high- resistivity 2kx2k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which are cooled by a large Stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. A filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type is designed that can hold up to ten large filters (205x170x15mm^3^). The wide-field corrector is basically a three-lens Wynne- type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector. The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of 30&quot; in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller than 30um peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image over the entire field. The median seeing in the I_c-band, measured over one year and a half, is 0&dquot;.61. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the time of commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging. For details, see: Miyazaki et al., Publ. Astron. Soc. Japan 54, 833-853, 2002 (2002PASJ...54..833M)</TD>

Subaru H images of UM673 (Koptelova+, 2014)</TD>
<TD>
We carried out H-band observations of UM673 with the Subaru Infra-Red Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) using an adaptive optics system with 188 control elements (AO188). The images were reduced following the procedure described in &dquot;Subaru Data Reduction CookBook: Imaging Observation with IRCS&dquot; by Y. Minowa (see also Minowa et al. 2005ApJ...629...29M). The final Subaru H-band stack image of UM673 was created by coadding 22 reduced single exposure images. We also created the exposure time map of the stack image. The 17x10arcsec subframe of the stack image and the corresponding exposure map displayed in Figures 1 and 2 of the paper are available as fits files.</TD>

The Initial Gaia Source List (IGSL) (Smart, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
The IGSL is a compilation catalog produced for the Gaia mission. We have combined data from the following catalogs or datasets to produce a homogenous list of positons, proper motions, photometry in a blue and red band and estimates of the magnitudes in the Gaia G and G_RVS bands. Included Catalogs: Tycho2, LQRF, UCAC4, SDSS-DR9, PPMXL, GSC23, GEPC, OGLE, Sky2000, 2MASS. Note that in compiling the various entries we did not consider the individual flags. Overall, we think this catalog is reliable but there will be errors, mismatches and duplicates. The user should use this catalog with that in mind, it is fine for statistical studies that has some way to remove obviously incorrect entries but it should only be used with care for individual objects. The source catalogs used to produce the IGSL are: * The Gaia Ecliptic Pole Catalog, version 3.0 (GEPC) Altmann &amp;amp; Bastian 2009, &dquot;Ecliptic Poles Catalogue Version 1.1&dquot; ESA Document GAIA-C3-TN-ARI-MA-002 URL http://www.rssd.esa.int/llink/livelink/open/2885828 * GSC2.3: GSC2 version 2.3, Lasker et al. 2008AJ....136..735L (I/305) * an excerpt of the 4th version of the Gaia Initial QSO Catalog (GIQC) as compiled by the GWP-S-335-13000, formed by Alexandre H.

Planck submillimetre sources in Virgo Cluster (Baes+, 2014)</TD>
<TD>
We cross-correlate the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS) with the fully sampled 84deg^2^ Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) fields. We search for and identify the 857 and 545GHz PCCS sources in the HeViCS fields by studying their FIR/submm and optical counterparts. We find 84 and 48 compact Planck sources in the HeViCS fields at 857 and 545GHz, respectively. Almost all sources correspond to individual bright Virgo Cluster galaxies. The vast majority of the Planck detected galaxies are late-type spirals, with the Sc class dominating the numbers, while early-type galaxies are virtually absent from the sample, especially at 545GHz. We compare the HeViCS SPIRE flux densities for the detected galaxies with the four different PCCS flux density estimators and find an excellent correlation with the aperture photometry flux densities, even at the highest flux density levels. We find only seven PCCS sources in the HeViCS fields without a nearby galaxy as obvious counterpart, and conclude that all of these are dominated by Galactic cirrus features or are spurious detections. No Planck sources in the HeViCS fields seem to be associated to high-redshift proto-clusters of dusty galaxies or strongly lensed submm sources. Finally, our study is the first empirical confirmation of the simulation-based estimated completeness of the PCCS, and provides a strong support of the internal PCCS validation procedure.</TD>

OGLE-II DIA microlensing events (Wozniak+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
We present a sample of microlensing events discovered in the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the OGLE-II images collected during three observing seasons, 1997-1999. 4424 light curves pass our criteria on the presence of a brightening episode on top of a constant baseline. Among those, 512 candidate microlensing events were selected visually. We designed an automated procedure, which unambiguously selects up to 237 best events. Including eight candidate events recovered by other means, a total of 520 light curves are presented in this work.</TD>

SDSS quasar lens search (Oguri+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
We present an algorithm for selecting a uniform sample of gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.2) quasars brighter than i=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our algorithm uses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small- and large-separation lenses, respectively. Our selection algorithm only relies on parameters that the SDSS standard image processing pipeline generates, allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. The algorithm has been tested against simulated SDSS images, which adopt distributions of field and quasar parameters taken from the real SDSS data as input. Furthermore, we take differential reddening into account. We find that our selection algorithm is almost complete down to separations of 1&dquot; and flux ratios of 10^-0.5^.</TD>

Chromospherically active stars in the Bulge (Drake, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
The MACHO project repeatedly imaged 67 million stars in a total of 182 observation fields toward the Galactic bulge, the LMC, and the SMC to detect the phenomenon of microlensing. These images were taken between 1992 and 2000 on the Mount Stromlo and Siding Springs Observatories&quot; 1.3m Great Melbourne Telescope with the 8x2048^2^pixel dual-color wide-field MACHO camera. In this analysis we concentrate on the Galactic bulge, where 33,000 observations of ~33 million stars were taken in 94 fields. Each observation field covers an area of 43&quot;x43&quot; on the sky. Most observations toward the Galactic bulge have exposure times of 150s.</TD>

Detailed morphology of SDSS galaxies (Nair+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of detailed visual classifications for 14034 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4, Cat. &amp;lt;II/267&amp;gt;). Our sample includes nearly all spectroscopically targeted galaxies in the redshift range 0.01&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.1 down to an apparent extinction-corrected limit of g&amp;lt;16mag. In addition to T-Types, we record the existence of bars, rings, lenses, tails, warps, dust lanes, arm flocculence, and multiplicity. This sample defines a comprehensive local galaxy sample which we will use in future papers to study low-redshift morphology. It will also prove useful for calibrating automated galaxy classification algorithms. In this paper, we describe the classification methodology used, detail the systematics and biases of our sample, and summarize the overall statistical properties of the sample, noting the most obvious trends that are relevant for general comparisons of our catalog with previously published work.</TD>

SDSS Quasar Lens Search. IV. (Inada+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
The 136 lensed quasar candidates taken from the 13,636 quasars constitute our targets for follow-up observations, but we remove two candidates that have already been examined. One is the morphologically selected candidate SDSS J111816.95+074558.1 which is the well-known lensed quasar PG1115+080 (Weymann et al. 1980Natur.285..641W). The other is the color-selected candidate SDSS J165502.02+260516.5, which is a pair of quasars with slightly different redshifts from SDSS spectroscopy. The remaining 134 candidates were observed as described in what follows using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical and/or near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 2 and 3.</TD>

SDSS quasar lens search. II. (Inada+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We report the first results of our systematic search for strongly lensed quasars using the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Among 46420 quasars from the SDSS Data Release 3 (~4188deg^2^), we select a subsample of 22683 quasars that are located at redshifts between 0.6 and 2.2 and are brighter than the Galactic extinction-corrected i-band magnitude of 19.1. We identify 220 lens candidates from the quasar subsample, for which we conduct extensive and systematic follow-up observations in optical and near-infrared wavebands, in order to construct a complete lensed quasar sample at image separations between 1&dquot; and 20&dquot; and flux ratios of faint to bright lensed images larger than 10^-0.5^. We construct a statistical sample of 11 lensed quasars. Ten of these are galaxy-scale lenses with small image separations (~1&dquot;-2&dquot;) and one is a large separation (15&dquot;) system which is produced by a massive cluster of galaxies, representing the first statistical sample of lensed quasars including both galaxy- and cluster-scale lenses. The Data Release 3 spectroscopic quasars contain an additional 11 lensed quasars outside the statistical sample.</TD>

400d Cluster Survey Weak Lensing Programme II (Israel+ 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Here, we present the final stacked ``coadded&quot;&quot; analysed in the paper. The data set consists of observations of eight fields centred on galaxy clusters selected from the 400d survey (Burenin et al., 2007, Cat. J/ApJS/172/561, Vikhlinin et al. 2009ApJ...692.1033V). All of these clusters have been observed with the Megacam wide-field imager, then located at the 6.5m MMT telescope at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (files MMT*). The galaxy shapes analysed in our article were drawn from the r&quot; band images (*_r.fits), consistently. For four of the clusters, auxiliary bands (g&quot;, i&quot;) could be observed and taken into account for galaxy selection. Note that the r&quot; band of CL 0030+2618 and the g&quot; and r&quot; bands were taken in non-photometric conditions, while the rest of the data is of photometric quality. We also include observations obtained with the CFHT MegaCam/MegaPrime imager (files CFHT*) for CL 1701+6414 in the g&quot;r&quot;i&quot;z&quot; filters, which we analysed for comparison. Note that the exposure time of these images in accessible in the fits headers via the TEXPTIME keyword, not via EXPTIME. For all images, we also include the weight and flag images used in our analysis, giving the pixel-to-pixel quality variation in the main files and regions excluded from the analysis, respectively.</TD>

Gravitational lenses among z&amp;gt;=4.0 quasars (Richards+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
Images of the 157 quasars were acquired with the High Resolution Camera (HRC) on the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Observations were taken in the SDSS i-band (F775W). The Wide-Field Camera on ACS has higher sensitivity in i than does the HRC but has substantially higher overhead and is mildly undersampled. The exposure times were 640s for each object: 320s in each of two exposures to help in cosmic-ray rejection.</TD>

Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (13th Ed.) (Veron+ 2010)</TD>
<TD>
This catalogue is a compilation of all known AGNs presented in a compact and convenient form. It is an update of the previous versions; and as in the previous editions no information about absorption lines of X-ray properties are given, but absolute magnitudes are given, assuming Ho=71km/s/Mpc and q_0_=0 (notice the change of cosmology: Ho was assumed to be 50km/s/Mpc in the previous editions). When available, the 20cm and 6cm radio flux are given. The present edition of this catalogue contains the quasars with measured redshift known prior to July 1st, 2009. It contains 133336 quasars, 1374 BL Lac objects and 34231 active galaxies (including 15627 Seyfert 1&quot;s), almost doubling the number listed in the 12th edition. Lists of known lensed quasars (table2.dat) and double quasars (table3.dat) are also given here.</TD>

Blanco survey of the lens BCS J2352-5452 (Buckley-Geer+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
The Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) is a 60 night NOAO (National Optical Astronomy Observatory) imaging survey program (2005-2008), using the Mosaic-II camera on the Blanco 4m telescope at CTIO (Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory), which has uniformly imaged 75deg^2^ of the sky in the SDSS griz bands. Observations of the lens, which is a rich cluster containing a prominent central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), were made with BCS imaging on 2006 Oct 30 (iz bands), 2006 Dec 14 (gr bands) and 2008 Nov 11 (gr bands) and with Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on 2007 Aug 4 and 14. We obtained GMOS spectra of the source and a number of neighboring galaxies (Lin et al. 2007, Gemini Proposal GS-2007B-Q-228).</TD>

Strong and weak lensing analysis of A2261 (Coe+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We observed A2261 (17:22:27.2+32:07:57 (J2000) for the BCG, brightest cluster galaxy) as part of the CLASH program in HST cycle 18 between 2011 March 9 and May 21 to a total depth of 20 orbits in 16 WFC3 and ACS filters, spanning ~2000-17000{AA} (GO 12066; PI: Postman). The full 20-orbit, 16-filter depth is achieved over a central area of 3.9arcmin^2^, comfortably including all the strongly lensed galaxies. We targeted probable A2261 cluster members based on their proximity to the expected cluster red sequence and proximity to the BCG (K. Rines et al. 2013, Cat. J/ApJ/767/15) with the Hectospec instrument mounted on the 6.5m MMT. In addition, all targets were sufficiently bright with magnitudes 16&amp;lt;r&quot;&amp;lt;21 in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7. Our weak-lensing analysis is based on archival BJVJRC imaging obtained with the 34&quot;x27&quot; FOV Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2m telescope and NOAO archival MOSAIC1 i&quot;z&quot; imaging obtained with the Mayall 4m telescope at KPNO (program 2008A-0356, PI.

South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zeldovich Survey Point Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This table contains a a point-source catalog from 771 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel&quot;dovich (SPT-SZ) survey at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. 1,545 sources are detected above 4.5-sigma significance in at least one band. Based on their relative brightness between survey bands, the authors classify the sources into two populations, one dominated by synchrotron emission from active galactic nuclei, and one dominated by thermal emission from dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. They find 1,238 synchrotron and 307 dusty sources. The authors cross-match all sources against external catalogs and find 189 unidentified synchrotron sources and 189 unidentified dusty sources. The dusty sources without counterparts are good candidates for high-redshift, strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies. The authors derive number counts for each population from 1 Jy down to roughly 11, 4, and 11 mJy at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. They compare these counts with galaxy population models and find that none of the models they consider for either population provide a good fit to the measured counts in all three bands. The disparities imply that these measurements will be an important input to the next generation of millimeter-wave extragalactic source population models. The SPT is a 10-m telescope located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station in Antarctica. At 150 GHz (2 mm), the SPT has arcminute angular resolution and a 1 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; diffraction-limited field of view. The SPT was designed for high-sensitivity millimeter/sub-millimeter observations of faint, low-contrast sources, such as CMB anisotropies. The first survey with the SPT, designated as the SPT-SZ survey, was completed in 2011 November and covers a ~2500 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; region of the southern extragalactic sky in three frequency bands, 95, 150, and 220 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 3.2, 2.0, and 1.4 mm. The fields were surveyed to depths of approximately 40, 18, and 70 microK arcmin at 95, 150, and 220NASA/GSFC HEASARC</TD>

BVI photometry of OGLE LMC Cepheids (Udalski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of Cepheids from the LMC. The Catalog contains 1333 objects detected in the 4.5 square degree area of central parts of the LMC. About 3.4*10^5^ BVI measurements of these stars were collected during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Catalog data include period, BVI photometry, astrometry, and R_21_, phi_21_ parameters of the Fourier decomposition of I-band light curve. The vast majority of objects from the Catalog are the classical Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode. The remaining objects include Population II Cepheids and red giants with pulsation-like light curves. Tests of completeness performed in overlapping parts of adjacent fields indicate that completeness of the Catalog is very high: &amp;gt;96%. Statistics and distributions of basic parameters of Cepheids are also presented. Finally, we show the light curves of three eclipsing systems containing Cepheid detected among objects of the Catalog. All presented data, including individual BVI observations are available from the OGLE Internet archive at URL: ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/var_stars/lmc/cep/catalog/</TD>

Gravitational lensing of SN 1997ff (Mortsell+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
We investigate the effects of gravitational lensing due to intervening galaxies on the recently discovered Type Ia supernova at z~1.7, SN 1997ff, in the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that it is possible to obtain a wide range of magnifications by varying the mass and/or the velocity dispersion normalization of the lensing galaxies. In order to be able to use SN 1997ff to constrain the redshift-distance relation, very detailed modeling of the galaxies to control the systematic effects from lensing is necessary. Thus, we argue that, based on our current limited knowledge of the lensing galaxies, it is difficult to use SN 1997ff to constrain the values of {Omega}_M_ and {Omega}_{Lambda}, or even to place severe limits on gray dust obscuration or luminosity evolution of Type Ia supernovae.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We argue that globular clusters (GCs) are good candidates for gravitational lenses in explaining quasar-galaxy associations. The catalog of associations (Bukhmastova, 2001, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AZh/78/675&amp;gt;) compiled from the LEDA catalog of galaxies (Paturel, 1997A&amp;amp;AS..124..109P) and from the catalog of quasars (Veron-Cetty and Vero, 1998, see Cat. &amp;lt;VII/235&amp;gt;) is used. Based on the new catalog, we show that one might expect an increased number of GCs around irregular galaxies of types 9 and 10 from the hypothesis that distant compact sources are gravitationally lensed by GCs in the halos of foreground galaxies. The King model is used to determine the central surface densities of 135 GCs in the Milky Way. The distribution of GCs in central surface density was found to be lognormal.</TD>

Gravitationally lensed arcs in the HST WFPC2 archive (Sand+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies located in the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 data archive. By carefully examining the images of 128 clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each of whose length-to-width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc candidates were identified with a length-to-width ratio of less than 7. Keck spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the radial arc sample from nonlensed objects is ~30%-50%.</TD>

Photometry and lines of (z~0.2-1.0) galaxies (Lamareille+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
We present the spectrophotometric properties of a sample of 141 emission-line galaxies at redshifts in the range 0.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;1.0 with a peak around 0.2&amp;lt;=z&amp;lt;=0.4. The analysis is based on medium resolution (Rs=500-600), optical spectra obtained at VLT and Keck. The targets are mostly &dquot;Canada-France Redshift Survey&dquot; (&amp;lt;VII/225&amp;gt;) emission-line galaxies, with the addition of field galaxies randomly selected behind lensing clusters. We complement this sample with galaxy spectra from the &dquot;Gemini Deep Deep Survey&dquot; (&amp;lt;J/AJ/127/2455&amp;gt;) public data release. We have computed absolute magnitudes of the galaxies and measured the line fluxes and equivalent widths of the main emission/absorption lines. The last two have been measured after careful subtraction of the fitted stellar continuum using the platefit software originally developed for the SDSS and adapted to our data. We present a careful comparison of this software with the results of manual measurements.</TD>

New bright periodic variables toward Galactic Bulge (Nataf+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
Our observations were taken over an 88 day span during the 2005 Bulge season, yielding 151 exposures over 61 distinct nights to image a 8.4x8.4 FOV. We used one of the HAT telescopes, HAT-9, located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. A 11cm diameter Cannon f/1.8L lens was used to image onto an Apogee AP10 2Kx2K CCD. The resulting pixel scale is 14&dquot;.</TD>

We present the catalog of 2580 eclipsing binary stars detected in 4.6 square degree area of the central parts of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The photometric data were collected during the second phase of the OGLE microlensing search from 1997 to 2000. The eclipsing objects were selected with the automatic search algorithm based on an artificial neural network. Basic statistics of eclipsing stars are presented. Also, the list of 36 candidates of detached eclipsing binaries for spectroscopic study and for precise LMC distance determination is provided. The full catalog is accessible from the OGLE Internet archive.</TD>

OGLE SMC BVI photometry (Udalski+ 1998)</TD>
<TD>
We present three color, BVI maps of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The maps contain precise photometric and astrometric data for about 2.2million stars from the central regions of the SMC bar covering ~2.4 square degrees on the sky. Mean brightness of stars is derived from observations collected in the course of the OGLE-II microlensing search from about 130, 30 and 15 measurements in the I, V and B-bands, respectively. Accuracy of the zero points of photometry is about 0.01mag, and astrometry 0.15arcsec (with possible systematic error up to 0.7arcsec). Color magnitude diagrams of observed fields are also presented. The maps of the SMC are the first from the series of similar maps covering other OGLE fields: LMC, Galactic bulge and Galactic disk. The data are very well suited for many projects, particularly for the SMC which has been neglected photometrically for years.</TD>

400d Cluster Survey Weak Lensing Programme II (Israel+ 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Here, we present the final stacked ``coadded&quot;&quot; analysed in the paper. The data set consists of observations of eight fields centred on galaxy clusters selected from the 400d survey (Burenin et al., 2007, Cat. J/ApJS/172/561, Vikhlinin et al. 2009ApJ...692.1033V). All of these clusters have been observed with the Megacam wide-field imager, then located at the 6.5m MMT telescope at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (files MMT*). The galaxy shapes analysed in our article were drawn from the r&quot; band images (*_r.fits), consistently. For four of the clusters, auxiliary bands (g&quot;, i&quot;) could be observed and taken into account for galaxy selection. Note that the r&quot; band of CL 0030+2618 and the g&quot; and r&quot; bands were taken in non-photometric conditions, while the rest of the data is of photometric quality. We also include observations obtained with the CFHT MegaCam/MegaPrime imager (files CFHT*) for CL 1701+6414 in the g&quot;r&quot;i&quot;z&quot; filters, which we analysed for comparison. Note that the exposure time of these images in accessible in the fits headers via the TEXPTIME keyword, not via EXPTIME. For all images, we also include the weight and flag images used in our analysis, giving the pixel-to-pixel quality variation in the main files and regions excluded from the analysis, respectively.</TD>

OGLE microlensing events in Galactic Bulge (Udalski+, 2000)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of microlensing events detected toward the Galactic bulge in three observing seasons, 1997-1999, during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The search for microlensing events was performed using a database of about 4x10^9^ photometric measurements of about 20.5 million stars from the Galactic bulge. The Catalog comprises 214 microlensing events found in the fields covering about 11 square degrees on the sky and distributed in different parts of the Galactic bulge. The sample includes 20 binary microlensing events, 14 of them are caustic crossing. In one case a double star is likely lensed. We present distribution of the basic parameters of microlensing events and show preliminary rate of microlensing in different regions of the Galactic bulge. The latter reveals clear dependence on the Galactic coordinates. The dependence on l indicates that the majority of lenses toward the Galactic bulge are located in the Galactic bar. Models of the Galactic bar seem to reasonably predict the observed spatial distribution of microlensing events in the Galactic bulge. All data presented in the Catalog and photometry of all events are available from the OGLE Internet archive.</TD>

Gravitationally lensed arcs in the HST WFPC2 archive (Sand+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies located in the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 data archive. By carefully examining the images of 128 clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each of whose length-to-width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc candidates were identified with a length-to-width ratio of less than 7. Keck spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the radial arc sample from nonlensed objects is ~30%-50%.</TD>

SDSS Quasar Lens Search. IV. (Inada+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
The 136 lensed quasar candidates taken from the 13,636 quasars constitute our targets for follow-up observations, but we remove two candidates that have already been examined. One is the morphologically selected candidate SDSS J111816.95+074558.1 which is the well-known lensed quasar PG1115+080 (Weymann et al. 1980Natur.285..641W). The other is the color-selected candidate SDSS J165502.02+260516.5, which is a pair of quasars with slightly different redshifts from SDSS spectroscopy. The remaining 134 candidates were observed as described in what follows using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical and/or near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 2 and 3.</TD>

SDSS quasar lens search. II. (Inada+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We report the first results of our systematic search for strongly lensed quasars using the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Among 46420 quasars from the SDSS Data Release 3 (~4188deg^2^), we select a subsample of 22683 quasars that are located at redshifts between 0.6 and 2.2 and are brighter than the Galactic extinction-corrected i-band magnitude of 19.1. We identify 220 lens candidates from the quasar subsample, for which we conduct extensive and systematic follow-up observations in optical and near-infrared wavebands, in order to construct a complete lensed quasar sample at image separations between 1&dquot; and 20&dquot; and flux ratios of faint to bright lensed images larger than 10^-0.5^. We construct a statistical sample of 11 lensed quasars. Ten of these are galaxy-scale lenses with small image separations (~1&dquot;-2&dquot;) and one is a large separation (15&dquot;) system which is produced by a massive cluster of galaxies, representing the first statistical sample of lensed quasars including both galaxy- and cluster-scale lenses. The Data Release 3 spectroscopic quasars contain an additional 11 lensed quasars outside the statistical sample.</TD>

We first identified galaxies for follow-up spectroscopy from two-color, wide-field imaging of each lens field. We obtained deep images in I and either V or R during the period from 2002 May to 2004 June using the 36&quot;x36&quot; Mosaic Imager on the 4m telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.</TD>

OGLE: Gaia South Ecliptic Pole Field (Soszynski+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Gaia South Ecliptic Pole (GSEP) field, 5.3 square degrees area around the South Ecliptic Pole on the outskirts of the LMC, based on the data collected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, OGLE-IV. The GSEP field will be observed during the commissioning phase of the ESA Gaia space mission for testing and calibrating the Gaia instruments. We provide the photometric maps of the GSEP region containing the mean VI photometry of all detected stellar objects and their equatorial coordinates. We show the quality and completeness of the OGLE-IV photometry and color-magnitude diagrams of this region. We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing variables. Several objects deserving special attention were also selected, including a new classical Cepheid in a binary eclipsing system.</TD>

OGLE high proper motion stars towards MC (Soszynski+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of high proper motion (HPM) stars detected in the foreground of central parts of the Magellanic Clouds. The Catalog contains 2161 objects in the 4.5 square degree area towards the LMC, and 892 HPM stars in the 2.4 square degree area towards the SMC. The Catalog is based on observations collected during four years of the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the images provided candidate HPM stars with proper motion as small as 4mas/yr. These appeared as pseudo-variables, and were all measured astrometrically on all CCD images, providing typically about 400 data points per star. The reference frame was defined by the majority of background stars, most of them members of the Magellanic Clouds. The reflex motion due to solar velocity with respect to the local standards of rest is clearly seen. The largest proper motion in our sample is 363mas/yr. Parallaxes were measured with errors smaller than 20% for several stars.</TD>

LMC Cepheids in OGLE and MACHO data (Poleski+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
Pulsation period of Cepheids should change as stars evolve through the instability strip. Rates of these changes found by other authors based on the decades-long OâC diagrams show rather good agreement with theoretical predictions. We have checked the variability on the scale of a few years on the data recently published by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) for the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids and found period changes for 18% of fundamental mode and 41% of first overtone pulsators. It suggest the overtone pulsations are less stable than the fundamental ones. For stars which had the cross-references in the MACHO catalog we have checked if the period change rates derived from the OGLE and the MACHO data are consistent.</TD>

VLBA calibrator survey: VCS1 catalog (Beasley+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
A catalog containing milli-arcsecond-accurate positions of 1332 extragalactic radio sources distributed over the northern sky is presented - the Very Long Baseline Array Calibrator Survey (VCS1). The positions have been derived from astrometric analysis of dual-frequency 2.3 and 8.4 GHz VLBA snapshot observations; in a majority of cases, images of the sources are also available. These radio sources are suitable for use in geodetic and astrometric experiments, and as phase-reference calibrators in high-sensitivity astronomical imaging. The VCS1 is the largest high-resolution radio survey ever undertaken and triples the number of sources available to the radio astronomy community for VLBI applications. In addition to the astrometric role, this survey can be used in active galactic nuclei, Galactic, gravitational lens, and cosmological studies.</TD>

Multiply imaged gravitational lens systems (Limousin+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution of galaxy cluster Abell 1689 at z=0.18 using detected strong lensing features from deep ACS observations and extensive ground based spectroscopy. Earlier analyses have reported up to 32 multiply imaged systems in this cluster, of which only 3 were spectroscopically confirmed. In this work, we present a parametric strong lensing mass reconstruction using 34 multiply imaged systems of which 24 have newly determined spectroscopic redshifts, which is a major step forward in building a robust mass model. In turn, the new spectroscopic data allows a more secure identification of multiply imaged systems.</TD>

We report a measurement of the streaming motion of the stars in the Galactic bar with the red clump giants (RCGs) using the data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II). We measure the proper motion of 46961 stars and divide RCGs into bright and faint subsamples that on average will be closer to the near and far sides of the bar, respectively. We find that the far-side RCGs (4979 stars) have a proper motion of {Delta}&amp;lt;{mu}&amp;gt;~1.5+/-0.11mas/yr toward the negative longitudes relative to the near-side RCGs (3610 stars).</TD>

OGLE high proper motion stars towards MC (Soszynski+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of high proper motion (HPM) stars detected in the foreground of central parts of the Magellanic Clouds. The Catalog contains 2161 objects in the 4.5 square degree area towards the LMC, and 892 HPM stars in the 2.4 square degree area towards the SMC. The Catalog is based on observations collected during four years of the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the images provided candidate HPM stars with proper motion as small as 4mas/yr. These appeared as pseudo-variables, and were all measured astrometrically on all CCD images, providing typically about 400 data points per star. The reference frame was defined by the majority of background stars, most of them members of the Magellanic Clouds. The reflex motion due to solar velocity with respect to the local standards of rest is clearly seen. The largest proper motion in our sample is 363mas/yr. Parallaxes were measured with errors smaller than 20% for several stars.</TD>

VLBA imaging and polarimetry survey at 5GHz (Helmboldt+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We have chosen the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS; Myers et al. 2003, Cat. &amp;lt;VIII/72&amp;gt;) as our parent sample. We have also restricted our sample to lie on the survey area, of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Among our target list, 141 have already been observed at 5 GHz with the VLBA as part of the Caltech-Jordell Bank Flat-Spectrum survey (CJF; Taylor et al., 1996ApJS..107...37T; Pollack et al., 2003, Cat. &amp;lt;J/ApJ/589/733&amp;gt;), eight have been or will be observed at 15GHz as part of the Monitoring of Jets in AGNs with VLBA Experiments (MOJAVE) project (Lister &amp;amp; Homan, 2005, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AJ/130/1389&amp;gt;), and 20 were observed for the VIPS pilot program at 5 and 15GHz (Taylor et al., 2005ApJS..159...27T). Each of these surveys contains VLBA observations at 5 or 15GHz that have adequate sensitivity for our purposes. The remaining 958 sources were observed with the VLBA within 18 separate observing runs of approximately 11hr each from 2006 January to August.</TD>

OGLE: Gaia South Ecliptic Pole Field (Soszynski+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Gaia South Ecliptic Pole (GSEP) field, 5.3 square degrees area around the South Ecliptic Pole on the outskirts of the LMC, based on the data collected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, OGLE-IV. The GSEP field will be observed during the commissioning phase of the ESA Gaia space mission for testing and calibrating the Gaia instruments. We provide the photometric maps of the GSEP region containing the mean VI photometry of all detected stellar objects and their equatorial coordinates. We show the quality and completeness of the OGLE-IV photometry and color-magnitude diagrams of this region. We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing variables. Several objects deserving special attention were also selected, including a new classical Cepheid in a binary eclipsing system.</TD>

The BAX Database (Blanchard+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
We present BAX, Base de Donnees Amas de Galaxies X (http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr), a multi-wavelength database dedicated to X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies allowing detailed information retrieval. BAX is designed to support astronomical research by providing access to published measurements of the main physical quantities and to the related bibliographic references: basic data stored in the database are cluster/group identifiers, equatorial coordinates, redshift, flux, X-ray luminosity (in the ROSAT band) and temperature, and links to additional linked parameters (in X-rays, such as spatial profile parameters, as well as SZ parameters of the hot gas, lensing measurements, and data at other wavelengths, such as optical and radio). The clusters and groups in BAX can be queried by the basic parameters as well as the linked parameters or combinations of these. We expect BAX to become an important tool for the astronomical community. BAX will optimize various aspects of the scientific analysis of X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies, from proposal planning to data collection, interpretation and publication, from both ground based facilities like MEGACAM (CFHT), VIRMOS (VLT) and space missions like XMM-Newton, Chandra and Planck.</TD>

Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum radio sample (Mckean+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We present the selection of the Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum (JBF) radio source sample, which is designed to reduce the uncertainties in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) gravitational lensing statistics arising from the lack of knowledge about the parent population luminosity function. From observations at 4.86GHz with the Very Large Array, we have selected a sample of 117 flat-spectrum radio sources with flux densities greater than 5mJy. These sources were selected in a similar manner to the CLASS complete sample and are therefore representative of the parent population at low flux densities. The vast majority (~90 per cent) of the JBF sample are found to be compact on the arcsec scales probed here and show little evidence of any extended radio jet emission. Using the JBF and CLASS complete samples, we find the differential number counts slope of the parent population above and below the CLASS 30-mJy flux density limit to be 2.07+/-0.02 and 1.96+/-0.12, respectively.</TD>

QSO luminosity function at z~4 (Glikman+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We make use of publicly available deep imaging data from the NDWFS (NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey) in the Bootes field from the DR3 (B_W_,R,I bands) and from the DLS (Deep Lens Survey; DR3 in B,V,R and z&quot; bands). DLS is closely related to the NDWFS in that the optical imaging has been obtained on the same 4m Mayall Telescope (at KPNO) and Blanco Telescope (at CTIO) using the same wide-field optical imagers Mosaic-I and Mosaic-II as the NDWFS. We obtained 28 spectra for the DLS and NDWFS candidates and found 23 high-redshift quasars (the remaining objects were three Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3.9, one Type-II active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z~0.2 and one featureless, unidentified spectrum). All but two of our spectra were taken with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea. Five quasars were discovered on UT 2005 November 28 and 29. Only the red camera was used, with the 400lines/mm grating blazed at 8500{AA}. Sixteen additional quasars were discovered during a run on UT 2006 May 20-22. Two additional spectra were taken on UT 2006 March 25 and 26 with the Multi-Aperture Red Spectrometer (MARS) on the Mayall 4m telescope at Kitt Peak.</TD>

Radio identification of EGRET sources (Mattox+ 1997)</TD>
<TD>
We present a method to assess the reliability of the identification of EGRET sources with extragalactic radio sources. We verify that EGRET is detecting the blazar class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However many published identifications are found to be questionable. We provide a table of 42 blazars that we expect to be robust identifications of EGRET sources. This includes one previously unidentified EGRET source, the lensed AGN PKS 1830-210, near the direction of the Galactic center. We provide the best available positions for 16 more radio sources that are also potential identifications for previously unidentified EGRET sources. All high Galactic latitude EGRET sources (|b|&amp;gt;3) that demonstrate significant variability can be identified with flat-spectrum radio sources. This suggests that EGRET is not detecting any type of AGN other than blazars. This identification method has been used to establish with 99.998% confidence that the peak gamma-ray flux of a blazar is correlated with its average 5GHz radio flux. An even better correlation is seen between gamma-ray flux and the 2.29GHz flux density measured with VLBI at the base of the radio jet. Also, using high-confidence identifications, we find that the radio sources identified with EGRET sources have greater correlated VLBI flux densities than the parent population of flat radio spectrum sources.</TD>

Redshift survey in the Subaru GTO2deg^2^ field (Kurtz+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Miyazaki et al. (2002ApJ...580L..97M, 2007, Cat. J/ApJ/669/714) used the 8.2m Subaru Telescope to carry out a weak-lensing survey of 13 well-separated fields covering a total of 21.82deg^2^. They used lensing convergence maps to identify 100 candidate halos with S/N {nu}&amp;gt;3.7; 10 of these candidates are within the GTO2deg^2^ field we examined here. We constructed the galaxy catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008, Cat. II/294) r-band galaxy list for the GTO2deg^2^ field. We acquired spectra for the objects with the Hectospec, a 300-fiber robotic instrument mounted on the MMT from 2009 February 1 to 2009 April 27. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3500-10000{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}.</TD>

MACHO Galactic Bulge microlensing events (Thomas+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of 450 relatively high signal-to-noise ratio microlensing events observed by the MACHO collaboration between 1993 and 1999. The events are distributed throughout our fields, and as expected, they show a clear concentration toward the Galactic center. No optical depth is given for this sample, since no blending efficiency calculation has been performed and we find evidence for substantial blending. In a companion paper we give optical depths for the subsample of events on clump giant source stars, where blending is a less significant effect. Several events with sources that may belong to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy are identified. For these events even relatively low dispersion spectra could suffice to classify these events as either consistent with Sagittarius membership or as non-Sagittarius sources. Several unusual events, such as microlensing of periodic variable source stars, binary lens events, and an event showing extended source effects, are identified. We also identify a number of contaminating background events as cataclysmic variable stars.</TD>

Flat-spectrum symmetric radio sources (Augusto+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
The radio sources listed below were selected from the Jodrell-VLA Astrometric Survey and the Cosmic-Lens All-Sky Survey (part 1) and constitute a (non-complete) parent sample for the selection of flat-spectrum symmetric object candidates (the ones which show structure, when their VLA-A 8.4GHz data are analysed). The parent sample contains northern hemisphere objects with 8.4GHz flux densities greater than 100mJy, galactic latitudes greater than 10 degrees and 1.40-to-4.85GHz spectral indices (when known; if not, the source is kept in the sample) smaller than 0.50 (flat). The most relevant properties of the parent sample are listed in the Table.</TD>

Shape of CL 1358+62 galaxies (Moller+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
Observations of early-type galaxies, both in the local Universe and in clusters at medium redshifts, suggest that these galaxies often contain discs or disc-like structures. Using the results of Kelson et al. (2000ApJ...531..137K) for the incidence of disc-components among the galaxies in the redshift z=0.33 cluster CL 1358+62, we investigate the effect of disc structures on the lensing properties of early-type galaxies. Statistical properties, like magnification cross-sections and the expected number of quad (four-image) lens systems, are not affected greatly by the inclusion of discs that contain less than ~10 per cent of the total stellar mass.</TD>

Spectroscopy of 26 lensing cluster cores (Bayliss+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
We observed a sample of 26 clusters with the Frederick C. Gillett Telescope (Gemini North) between 2008 February and 2010 June as part of Gemini programs GN-2008A-Q-25 and GN-2009A-Q-21. We obtained pre-imaging of 20 of the 26 clusters in gri with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). In addition to the Gemini/GMOS-North spectroscopy, we supplement our data set with cluster member redshift measurements made at the 3.5m Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) Telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, using the Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) in long-slit mode.</TD>

Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (13th Ed.) (Veron+ 2010)</TD>
<TD>
This catalogue is a compilation of all known AGNs presented in a compact and convenient form. It is an update of the previous versions; and as in the previous editions no information about absorption lines of X-ray properties are given, but absolute magnitudes are given, assuming Ho=71km/s/Mpc and q_0_=0 (notice the change of cosmology: Ho was assumed to be 50km/s/Mpc in the previous editions). When available, the 20cm and 6cm radio flux are given. The present edition of this catalogue contains the quasars with measured redshift known prior to July 1st, 2009. It contains 133336 quasars, 1374 BL Lac objects and 34231 active galaxies (including 15627 Seyfert 1&quot;s), almost doubling the number listed in the 12th edition. Lists of known lensed quasars (table2.dat) and double quasars (table3.dat) are also given here.</TD>

The Initial Gaia Source List (IGSL) (Smart, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
The IGSL is a compilation catalog produced for the Gaia mission. We have combined data from the following catalogs or datasets to produce a homogenous list of positons, proper motions, photometry in a blue and red band and estimates of the magnitudes in the Gaia G and G_RVS bands. Included Catalogs: Tycho2, LQRF, UCAC4, SDSS-DR9, PPMXL, GSC23, GEPC, OGLE, Sky2000, 2MASS. Note that in compiling the various entries we did not consider the individual flags. Overall, we think this catalog is reliable but there will be errors, mismatches and duplicates. The user should use this catalog with that in mind, it is fine for statistical studies that has some way to remove obviously incorrect entries but it should only be used with care for individual objects. The source catalogs used to produce the IGSL are: * The Gaia Ecliptic Pole Catalog, version 3.0 (GEPC) Altmann &amp;amp; Bastian 2009, &dquot;Ecliptic Poles Catalogue Version 1.1&dquot; ESA Document GAIA-C3-TN-ARI-MA-002 URL http://www.rssd.esa.int/llink/livelink/open/2885828 * GSC2.3: GSC2 version 2.3, Lasker et al. 2008AJ....136..735L (I/305) * an excerpt of the 4th version of the Gaia Initial QSO Catalog (GIQC) as compiled by the GWP-S-335-13000, formed by Alexandre H.

SDSS Quasar Lens Search. V. Final catalog (Inada+, 2012)</TD>

We start with the 105783 quasars in the SDSS-DR7 quasar catalog selected over 8000 deg^2^ (Schneider et al., 2010, Cat. VII/260, superseded by Cat. VII/269). Our selection (see Section 2) lead to a sample of 50836 source quasars. 174 new lensed quasar candidates were observed using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical imaging, near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. Together with the results we reported in Paper II (Inada et al., 2008, Cat. J/AJ/135/496) and Paper IV (Inada et al., 2010, Cat. J/AJ/140/403), we have constructed a statistical sample of 26 lensed quasar (table 5).</TD>

QSO luminosity function at z~4 (Glikman+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We make use of publicly available deep imaging data from the NDWFS (NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey) in the Bootes field from the DR3 (B_W_,R,I bands) and from the DLS (Deep Lens Survey; DR3 in B,V,R and z&quot; bands). DLS is closely related to the NDWFS in that the optical imaging has been obtained on the same 4m Mayall Telescope (at KPNO) and Blanco Telescope (at CTIO) using the same wide-field optical imagers Mosaic-I and Mosaic-II as the NDWFS. We obtained 28 spectra for the DLS and NDWFS candidates and found 23 high-redshift quasars (the remaining objects were three Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3.9, one Type-II active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z~0.2 and one featureless, unidentified spectrum). All but two of our spectra were taken with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea. Five quasars were discovered on UT 2005 November 28 and 29. Only the red camera was used, with the 400lines/mm grating blazed at 8500{AA}. Sixteen additional quasars were discovered during a run on UT 2006 May 20-22. Two additional spectra were taken on UT 2006 March 25 and 26 with the Multi-Aperture Red Spectrometer (MARS) on the Mayall 4m telescope at Kitt Peak.</TD>

OGLE: Gaia South Ecliptic Pole Field (Soszynski+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Gaia South Ecliptic Pole (GSEP) field, 5.3 square degrees area around the South Ecliptic Pole on the outskirts of the LMC, based on the data collected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, OGLE-IV. The GSEP field will be observed during the commissioning phase of the ESA Gaia space mission for testing and calibrating the Gaia instruments. We provide the photometric maps of the GSEP region containing the mean VI photometry of all detected stellar objects and their equatorial coordinates. We show the quality and completeness of the OGLE-IV photometry and color-magnitude diagrams of this region. We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing variables. Several objects deserving special attention were also selected, including a new classical Cepheid in a binary eclipsing system.</TD>

Spectroscopy of 26 lensing cluster cores (Bayliss+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
We observed a sample of 26 clusters with the Frederick C. Gillett Telescope (Gemini North) between 2008 February and 2010 June as part of Gemini programs GN-2008A-Q-25 and GN-2009A-Q-21. We obtained pre-imaging of 20 of the 26 clusters in gri with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). In addition to the Gemini/GMOS-North spectroscopy, we supplement our data set with cluster member redshift measurements made at the 3.5m Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) Telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, using the Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) in long-slit mode.</TD>

LMC Cepheids in OGLE and MACHO data (Poleski+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
Pulsation period of Cepheids should change as stars evolve through the instability strip. Rates of these changes found by other authors based on the decades-long OâC diagrams show rather good agreement with theoretical predictions. We have checked the variability on the scale of a few years on the data recently published by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) for the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids and found period changes for 18% of fundamental mode and 41% of first overtone pulsators. It suggest the overtone pulsations are less stable than the fundamental ones. For stars which had the cross-references in the MACHO catalog we have checked if the period change rates derived from the OGLE and the MACHO data are consistent.</TD>

Exoplanet masses derived from RVs (Brown+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Exoplanet searches using radial velocity (RV) and microlensing (ML) produce samples of &dquot;projected&dquot; mass and orbital radius, respectively. We present a new method for estimating the probability density distribution (density) of the unprojected quantity from such samples. For a sample of n data values, the method involves solving n simultaneous linear equations to determine the weights of delta functions for the raw, unsmoothed density of the unprojected quantity that cause the associated cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the projected quantity to exactly reproduce the empirical CDF of the sample at the locations of the n data values. We smooth the raw density using nonparametric kernel density estimation with a normal kernel of bandwidth {sigma}. We calibrate the dependence of {sigma} on n by Monte Carlo experiments performed on samples drawn from a theoretical density, in which the integrated square error is minimized. We scale this calibration to the ranges of real RV samples using the Normal Reference Rule. The resolution and amplitude accuracy of the estimated density improve with n. For typical RV and ML samples, we expect the fractional noise at the PDF peak to be approximately 80n^-log2^. For illustrations, we apply the new method to 67 RV values given a similar treatment by Jorissen et al. (2001A&amp;amp;A...379..992J), and to the 308 RV values listed at exoplanets.org on 2010 October 20.</TD>

Spectroscopy of bright M dwarfs in the northern sky (Lepine+, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
Targets for the follow-up spectroscopic program were selected from the catalog of 8889 bright M dwarfs of Lepine &amp;amp; Gaidos (2011, cat. J/AJ/142/138). All stars are selected from the SUPERBLINK catalog of stars (Lepine &amp;amp; Shara, 2005, cat. I/298) with proper motions {mu}&amp;gt;40mas/yr. Of the 1564 M dwarf candidates, we found that 286 had been observed at the MDM observatory by one of us (SL) prior to 2008 November, as part of a separate spectroscopic follow-up survey of very nearby (d&amp;lt;20pc) stars (Alpert &amp;amp; Lepine, 2011AAS...21724211A). The remaining targets were distributed between our observing teams at the MDM Observatory and University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope (UH22), with the MDM team in charge of higher declination targets ({delta}&amp;gt;30) and the UH22 team in charge of the lower declination range (0&amp;lt;{delta}&amp;lt;30). Spectra were collected at the MDM observatory in a series of 22 observing runs scheduled between 2002 June and 2012 April. Most of the spectra were collected at the McGraw-Hill 1.3m telescope, but a number were obtained at the neighboring Hiltner 2.4m telescope. Two different spectrographs were used: the MkIII spectrograph, and the CCDS spectrograph. Both are facility instruments which provide low- to medium-resolution spectroscopy in the optical regime. Their operation at either 1.3m or 2.4m telescopes is identical. Data were collected in slit spectroscopy mode, with an effective slit width of 1.0&dquot; to 1.5&dquot;. The MkIII spectrograph was used with two different gratings: the 300l/mm grating blazed at 8000{AA}, providing a spectral resolution R~2000, and the 600l/mm grating blazed at 5800{AA}, which provides R~4000. The two gratings were used with either one of two thick-chip CCD cameras (Wilbur and Nellie) both having negligible fringing in the red. Spectra for a total of 901 bright M dwarf targets were collected at MDM. Additional spectra were obtained with the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope on Mauna Kea between 2009 February anCDS</TD>

Optical properties of WISE galaxies (Hwang+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
The Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey (SHELS) is a magnitude-limited redshift survey covering the 4deg^2^ region of the DLS (Deep Lens Survey) F2 field (Geller et al. 2005ApJ...635L.125G, 2010ApJ...709..832G, 2012, Cat. J/AJ/143/102). The F2 field is one of the five fields and is centered on RA=09h19m32.4s and DE=+30:00:00. The DLS R-band images were taken in seeing 0.9&dquot;; the source detection on these images reaches down to 28.7mag/arcsec^2^. The spectroscopic observations for SHELS galaxies were conducted for galaxies down to Rmag=20.6 with the Hectospec 300 fiber spectrograph on the MMT (see Geller et al. 2012, Cat. J/AJ/143/102, for detailed description of the spectroscopic observations). The spectra cover the wavelength range 3650-9150{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}. We use the WISE all-sky survey catalog, which contains uniform photometric data for over 563 million objects at four MIR bands (3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22um). WISE covers the entire region of the SHELS field to a homogeneous depth.</TD>

Submm observations in gravitational lenses (Knudsen+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We have conducted a submillimetre mapping survey of faint, gravitationally lensed sources, where we have targeted 12 galaxy clusters and additionally the New Technology Telescope (NTT) Deep Field. The total area surveyed is 71.5arcmin^2^ in the image plane; correcting for gravitational lensing, the total area surveyed is 40arcmin^2^ in the source plane for a typical source redshift z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;2.5. In the deepest maps, an image plane depth of 1{sigma} rms ~0.8mJy is reached. This survey is the largest survey to date to reach such depths. In total 59 sources were detected, including three multiply imaged sources. The gravitational lensing makes it possible to detect sources with flux density below the blank field confusion limit. The lensing-corrected fluxes range from 0.11 to 19mJy. After correcting for multiplicity, there are 10 sources with fluxes &amp;lt;2mJy of which seven have submJy fluxes, doubling the number of such sources known. Number counts are determined below the confusion limit. At 1mJy, the integrated number count is ~10^4^deg^-2^, and at 0.5mJy it is ~2x10^4^deg^-2^. Based on the number counts, at a source plan flux limit of 0.1mJy, essentially all of the 850-m background emission has been resolved. The dominant contribution (&amp;gt;50 per cent) to the integrated background arises from sources with fluxes S850 between 0.4 and 2.5mJy, while the bright sources S850&amp;gt;6mJy contribute only 10 per cent.</TD>

Photometry and lines of (z~0.2-1.0) galaxies (Lamareille+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
We present the spectrophotometric properties of a sample of 141 emission-line galaxies at redshifts in the range 0.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;1.0 with a peak around 0.2&amp;lt;=z&amp;lt;=0.4. The analysis is based on medium resolution (Rs=500-600), optical spectra obtained at VLT and Keck. The targets are mostly &dquot;Canada-France Redshift Survey&dquot; (&amp;lt;VII/225&amp;gt;) emission-line galaxies, with the addition of field galaxies randomly selected behind lensing clusters. We complement this sample with galaxy spectra from the &dquot;Gemini Deep Deep Survey&dquot; (&amp;lt;J/AJ/127/2455&amp;gt;) public data release. We have computed absolute magnitudes of the galaxies and measured the line fluxes and equivalent widths of the main emission/absorption lines. The last two have been measured after careful subtraction of the fitted stellar continuum using the platefit software originally developed for the SDSS and adapted to our data. We present a careful comparison of this software with the results of manual measurements.</TD>

BVI photometry of OGLE SMC eclipsing binaries (Udalski+, 1998)</TD>
<TD>
We present the catalog of 1459 eclipsing binary stars detected in the central 2.4 square degree area of the Small Magellanic Cloud during the OGLE-II microlensing search. The sample includes objects brighter than I~20mag with periods ranging from about 0.3 to 250 days. The average completeness of the catalog is about 80%. Statistics of the entire sample and well detached systems, suitable for distance determination, are also presented.</TD>

QSO luminosity function at z~4 (Glikman+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We make use of publicly available deep imaging data from the NDWFS (NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey) in the Bootes field from the DR3 (B_W_,R,I bands) and from the DLS (Deep Lens Survey; DR3 in B,V,R and z&quot; bands). DLS is closely related to the NDWFS in that the optical imaging has been obtained on the same 4m Mayall Telescope (at KPNO) and Blanco Telescope (at CTIO) using the same wide-field optical imagers Mosaic-I and Mosaic-II as the NDWFS. We obtained 28 spectra for the DLS and NDWFS candidates and found 23 high-redshift quasars (the remaining objects were three Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3.9, one Type-II active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z~0.2 and one featureless, unidentified spectrum). All but two of our spectra were taken with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea. Five quasars were discovered on UT 2005 November 28 and 29. Only the red camera was used, with the 400lines/mm grating blazed at 8500{AA}. Sixteen additional quasars were discovered during a run on UT 2006 May 20-22. Two additional spectra were taken on UT 2006 March 25 and 26 with the Multi-Aperture Red Spectrometer (MARS) on the Mayall 4m telescope at Kitt Peak.</TD>

Radio identification of EGRET sources (Mattox+ 1997)</TD>
<TD>
We present a method to assess the reliability of the identification of EGRET sources with extragalactic radio sources. We verify that EGRET is detecting the blazar class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However many published identifications are found to be questionable. We provide a table of 42 blazars that we expect to be robust identifications of EGRET sources. This includes one previously unidentified EGRET source, the lensed AGN PKS 1830-210, near the direction of the Galactic center. We provide the best available positions for 16 more radio sources that are also potential identifications for previously unidentified EGRET sources. All high Galactic latitude EGRET sources (|b|&amp;gt;3) that demonstrate significant variability can be identified with flat-spectrum radio sources. This suggests that EGRET is not detecting any type of AGN other than blazars. This identification method has been used to establish with 99.998% confidence that the peak gamma-ray flux of a blazar is correlated with its average 5GHz radio flux. An even better correlation is seen between gamma-ray flux and the 2.29GHz flux density measured with VLBI at the base of the radio jet. Also, using high-confidence identifications, we find that the radio sources identified with EGRET sources have greater correlated VLBI flux densities than the parent population of flat radio spectrum sources.</TD>

Catalogue of eclipsing binaries in the SMC (Bayne+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
The catalogue lists 167 eclipsing binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud detected in the database of time-series photometry for 400000 SMC stars acquired by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) project during 1997. Coordinates, ephemerides, magnitudes and light curves are presented. Thirty-five systems are new detections. The limiting magnitude is about 17.5. The majority of periods lie within the range 0.4 to 20 days; 6 systems are possibly eccentric while 14 are probably or certainly so. The majority of the newly-identified systems lie in the outer regions of the SMC.</TD>

Liverpool Quasar Lens Monitoring</TD>
<TD>
This collection includes optical monitorings of gravitationally lensed quasars. The frames can be used to make light curves of quasar images and field objects. From quasar light curves, one may measure time delays and flux ratios, analyse variability and chromaticity, etc. These direct analyses/measurements are basic tools for different astrophysical studies, e.g., expansion rate of the Universe, mechanism of intrinsic variability in quasars, accretion disk structure, supermassive black holes, dark halos of galaxies (dust, collapsed dark matter, smoothly distributed dark matter,...)</TD>

Shape of CL 1358+62 galaxies (Moller+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
Observations of early-type galaxies, both in the local Universe and in clusters at medium redshifts, suggest that these galaxies often contain discs or disc-like structures. Using the results of Kelson et al. (2000ApJ...531..137K) for the incidence of disc-components among the galaxies in the redshift z=0.33 cluster CL 1358+62, we investigate the effect of disc structures on the lensing properties of early-type galaxies. Statistical properties, like magnification cross-sections and the expected number of quad (four-image) lens systems, are not affected greatly by the inclusion of discs that contain less than ~10 per cent of the total stellar mass.</TD>

OGLE-II High proper motion stars (Eyer+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
The difference image analysis (DIA) of the images obtained by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-II) revealed a peculiar artefact in the sample of stars proposed as variable by Woniak in one of the Galactic bulge fields: the occurrence of pairs of candidate variables showing anti-correlated light curves monotonic over a period of 3 yr. This effect can be understood, quantified and related to the stellar proper motions. DIA photometry supplemented with a simple model offers an effective and easy way to detect high proper motion stars in very dense stellar fields, where conventional astrometric searches are extremely inefficient.</TD>

2002-2007 PLANET microlensing events (Assan+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Most known extrasolar planets (exoplanets) have been discovered using the radial velocity or transit methods. Both are biased towards planets that are relatively close to their parent stars, and studies find that around 17-30% of solar-like stars host a planet. Gravitational microlensing on the other hand, probes planets that are further away from their stars. Recently, a population of planets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered by microlensing. These planets are at least as numerous as the stars in the Milky Way. Here we report a statistical analysis of microlensing data (gathered in 2002-07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5-10AU (Sun-Earth distance) from their stars. We find that of stars host Jupiter-mass planets (0.3-10M_J_, where M_J_=318M_{earth}_ and M_{earth}_ is Earth&quot;s mass). Cool Neptunes (10-30M_{earth}_) and super-Earths (5-10M_{earth}_) are even more common: their respective abundances per star are 52^+22^_-29_% and 62^+35^_-37_%. We conclude that stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception.</TD>

SHELS galaxies with 0.02&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.1 (Geller+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
The Deep Lens Survey (DLS, Wittman et al., 2006ApJ...643..128W) is an National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) key program covering 20deg^2^ in five separate fields; we use the 4deg^2^ F2 field at {alpha}=09h19m32.4s and {delta}=+30{deg}00&quot;00&dquot;. The DLS photometry offers the possibility of identifying galaxies with lower surface brightness. Photometric observations of F2 were made with the MOSAIC I imager on the KPNO Mayall 4m telescope between 1999 November and 2004 November. We constructed a galaxy catalog from the R-band source list in F2. We selected galaxy candidates with Kron-Cousins R&amp;lt;=20.6 for spectroscopic observation. SHELS (Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey, Geller et al., 2005ApJ...635L.125G, 2010ApJ...709..832G) is a redshift survey covering the DLS survey F2 field. The SHELS spectra cover the wavelength range 3700-9100{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}. SHELS contains 541 galaxies with R&amp;lt;=20.6 at z&amp;lt;=0.1. We acquired spectra for the objects with the Hectospec on the MMT from 2004 April 13 to 2007 April 20.</TD>

OGLE: Gaia South Ecliptic Pole Field (Soszynski+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Gaia South Ecliptic Pole (GSEP) field, 5.3 square degrees area around the South Ecliptic Pole on the outskirts of the LMC, based on the data collected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, OGLE-IV. The GSEP field will be observed during the commissioning phase of the ESA Gaia space mission for testing and calibrating the Gaia instruments. We provide the photometric maps of the GSEP region containing the mean VI photometry of all detected stellar objects and their equatorial coordinates. We show the quality and completeness of the OGLE-IV photometry and color-magnitude diagrams of this region. We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing variables. Several objects deserving special attention were also selected, including a new classical Cepheid in a binary eclipsing system.</TD>

MACHO Galactic Bulge microlensing events (Thomas+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of 450 relatively high signal-to-noise ratio microlensing events observed by the MACHO collaboration between 1993 and 1999. The events are distributed throughout our fields, and as expected, they show a clear concentration toward the Galactic center. No optical depth is given for this sample, since no blending efficiency calculation has been performed and we find evidence for substantial blending. In a companion paper we give optical depths for the subsample of events on clump giant source stars, where blending is a less significant effect. Several events with sources that may belong to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy are identified. For these events even relatively low dispersion spectra could suffice to classify these events as either consistent with Sagittarius membership or as non-Sagittarius sources. Several unusual events, such as microlensing of periodic variable source stars, binary lens events, and an event showing extended source effects, are identified. We also identify a number of contaminating background events as cataclysmic variable stars.</TD>

Strong and weak lensing analysis of A2261 (Coe+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We observed A2261 (17:22:27.2+32:07:57 (J2000) for the BCG, brightest cluster galaxy) as part of the CLASH program in HST cycle 18 between 2011 March 9 and May 21 to a total depth of 20 orbits in 16 WFC3 and ACS filters, spanning ~2000-17000{AA} (GO 12066; PI: Postman). The full 20-orbit, 16-filter depth is achieved over a central area of 3.9arcmin^2^, comfortably including all the strongly lensed galaxies. We targeted probable A2261 cluster members based on their proximity to the expected cluster red sequence and proximity to the BCG (K. Rines et al. 2013, Cat. J/ApJ/767/15) with the Hectospec instrument mounted on the 6.5m MMT. In addition, all targets were sufficiently bright with magnitudes 16&amp;lt;r&quot;&amp;lt;21 in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7. Our weak-lensing analysis is based on archival BJVJRC imaging obtained with the 34&quot;x27&quot; FOV Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2m telescope and NOAO archival MOSAIC1 i&quot;z&quot; imaging obtained with the Mayall 4m telescope at KPNO (program 2008A-0356, PI. Mandelbaum).</TD>

BVR photometry of MS0302+17 (Gavazzi+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
We report the sample of galaxies we used for the MS0302+17 photometric and weak lensing analysis, observed on October 12, 1999 with the CFH12K camera mounted at the prime focus of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. In the same file, we report background lensed galaxies, supercluster and foreground early-types galaxies. Stars are also presented. When unknown, fields are assigned an arbitrary value of -99.00. The AB photometry is for CFH12k filters. The R image is much deeper. So we detected more objects with sometimes no B or V reliable counter-part. Coordinates are in J2000. We introduce a flag in order to identify the type. Lenses (either supercluster members (flag=2) or foreground(flag=3)) do not contribute to the lensing signal and we do not report ellipticity components whereas for background galaxies (flag=1), we report (e1,e2) components with the corresponding uncertainty. They are corrected from PSF smearing using standard KSB method. We also report stars (flag=4) that have been used for PSF smearing correction. In this case, we report (e1,e2) ellipticity components before and after psf-correction. Unused objects (that may contain spurious detections!!) are reported with flag=0. Use them with caution.</TD>

Subaru H images of UM673 (Koptelova+, 2014)</TD>
<TD>
We carried out H-band observations of UM673 with the Subaru Infra-Red Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) using an adaptive optics system with 188 control elements (AO188). The images were reduced following the procedure described in &dquot;Subaru Data Reduction CookBook: Imaging Observation with IRCS&dquot; by Y. Minowa (see also Minowa et al. 2005ApJ...629...29M). The final Subaru H-band stack image of UM673 was created by coadding 22 reduced single exposure images. We also created the exposure time map of the stack image. The 17x10arcsec subframe of the stack image and the corresponding exposure map displayed in Figures 1 and 2 of the paper are available as fits files.</TD>

Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (Buta+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
The Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) is a comprehensive compilation of diameters, axis ratios, relative bar position angles, and morphologies of inner and outer rings, pseudorings, and lenses in 3692 galaxies south of declination -17{deg}. The purpose of the catalog is to evaluate the idea that these ring phenomena are related to orbital resonances with a bar or oval in galaxy potentials. The catalog is based on visual inspection of most of the 606 fields of the Science Research Council (SRC) IIIa-J southern sky survey, with the ESO-B, ESO-R, and Palomar Sky surveys used as auxiliaries when needed for overexposed core regions. The catalog is most complete for SRC fields 1-303 (mostly south of declination -42{deg}). In addition to ringed galaxies, a list of 859 mostly nonringed galaxies intended for comparison with other catalogs is provided.</TD>

BAX X-Ray Galaxy Clusters and Groups Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the BAX X-Ray Galaxy Clusters and Groups Catalog. BAX (`Base de Donnees Amas de Galaxies X&quot;: see &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&dquot;&amp;gt;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for more details) is a multi-wavelength database dedicated to X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies which allows detailed information retrieval. BAX is designed to support astronomical research by providing access to published measurements of the main physical quantities and to the related bibliographic references: basic data stored in the database are cluster/group identifiers, equatorial coordinates, redshift, flux, X-ray luminosity (in the ROSAT band) and temperature, and (in the online version at &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&dquot;&amp;gt;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) links to additional linked parameters (in X-rays, such as spatial profile parameters, as well as SZ parameters of the hot gas, lensing measurements, and data at other wavelengths, such as the optical and radio bands). The clusters and groups in the online BAX database can be queried by the basic parameters as well as the linked parameters or combinations of these. The authors expect BAX to become an important tool for the astronomical community. BAX will optimize various aspects of the scientific analysis of X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies, from proposal planning to data collection, interpretation and publication, from both ground based facilities like MEGACAM (CFHT), VIRMOS (VLT) and from space missions like XMM-Newton, Chandra and Planck.</TD>

The present catalog contains the most numerous, observationally homogeneous sample of contact binaries. It is derived from the OGLE experiment (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment), in the direction of the Galactic Bulge and the Galactic bar. The observations were made with the 1-m Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, over the period 1992 to 1995. The present catalog includes the 1575 newly discovered contact binaries fainter than I=18mag as well as the 1165 brighter contact binaries previously published. It also includes a list of 506 objects with nearly sinusoidal light curves, to ease the comparison and/or distinction between contact binaries with the sinusoidal light curves and pulsating stars.</TD>

Chromospherically active stars in the Bulge (Drake, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
The MACHO project repeatedly imaged 67 million stars in a total of 182 observation fields toward the Galactic bulge, the LMC, and the SMC to detect the phenomenon of microlensing. These images were taken between 1992 and 2000 on the Mount Stromlo and Siding Springs Observatories&quot; 1.3m Great Melbourne Telescope with the 8x2048^2^pixel dual-color wide-field MACHO camera. In this analysis we concentrate on the Galactic bulge, where 33,000 observations of ~33 million stars were taken in 94 fields. Each observation field covers an area of 43&quot;x43&quot; on the sky. Most observations toward the Galactic bulge have exposure times of 150s.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We argue that globular clusters (GCs) are good candidates for gravitational lenses in explaining quasar-galaxy associations. The catalog of associations (Bukhmastova, 2001, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AZh/78/675&amp;gt;) compiled from the LEDA catalog of galaxies (Paturel, 1997A&amp;amp;AS..124..109P) and from the catalog of quasars (Veron-Cetty and Vero, 1998, see Cat. &amp;lt;VII/235&amp;gt;) is used. Based on the new catalog, we show that one might expect an increased number of GCs around irregular galaxies of types 9 and 10 from the hypothesis that distant compact sources are gravitationally lensed by GCs in the halos of foreground galaxies. The King model is used to determine the central surface densities of 135 GCs in the Milky Way. The distribution of GCs in central surface density was found to be lognormal.</TD>

Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (12th Ed.) (Veron+ 2006)</TD>
<TD>
This catalogue is an update of the previous versions; as in the previous editions no information about absorption lines of X-ray properties are given, but absolute magnitudes are given, assuming Ho=50km/s/Mpc and q_0_=0. In this edition the 20cm radio flux is listed when available, in place of the 11cm flux. The present edition of this catalogue contains the quasars with measured redshift known prior to January 1st, 2006. It contains 85221 quasars, 1122 BL Lac objects and 21737 active galaxies (including 9628 Seyfert 1s), almost doubling the number listed in the 11th edition. Lists of known lensed quasars (table2.dat) and double quasars (table3.dat) are also given here.</TD>

Spectra of 13 lensed quasars (Sluse+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Extracted flux calibrated spectra of 13 lensed quasars following the methodology described in Sect. 2.1. of the oaoer. The data were obtained with the FORS spectrograph at VLT in multi-object spectroscopy mode. The typical wavelength coverage is from 4200 to 8200{AA}. The data concern the following objects: HE0047-1756 (HE0047), Q0142-100 (Q0142), SDSSJ0246-0825 (SDSS0246), HE0435-1223 (HE0435), SDSSJ0806+2006 (SDSS0806), FBQ0951+2635 (FBQ0951), BRI0952-0115 (BRI0952), SDSSJ1138+0314 (J1138), J1226-0006 (J1226), SDSSJ1335+0118 (J1335), Q1355-2257 (Q1355), WFI2033-4723 (WFI2033), and HE2149-2745 (HE2149). For each object, we provide the 1D flux calibrated spectrum of the 2 individual images in the slit. In addition, we also provide the 2D reduced spectrum and corresponding 1{sigma} error frame (corresponding files are named &dquot;objectname_data&dquot; and &dquot;objectname_err&dquot;), and the 2D processed spectra associated to the deconvolution, as shown in Fig.1 of the paper. These processed 2D spectra are the deconvolved frame (&dquot;_dec&dquot;), the extended component of the flux emission (&dquot;_ext&dquot;) and the residual frame in {sigma} units (&dquot;_res&dquot;) corresponding to panel (b), (c) and (d) of Fig.1. A pdf file file similar to Fig.1 is also provided for each object.</TD>

Gravitational lensing flexion in A1689 with an AIM (Cain+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Measuring dark matter substructure within galaxy cluster halos is a fundamental probe of the {Lambda}CDM model of structure formation. Gravitational lensing is a technique for measuring the total mass distribution which is independent of the nature of the gravitating matter, making it a vital tool for studying these dark-matter-dominated objects. We present a new method for measuring weak gravitational lensing flexion fields, the gradients of the lensing shear field, to measure mass distributions on small angular scales. While previously published methods for measuring flexion focus on measuring derived properties of the lensed images, such as shapelet coefficients or surface brightness moments, our method instead fits a mass-sheet transformation invariant Analytic Image Model (AIM) to each galaxy image. This simple parametric model traces the distortion of lensed image isophotes and constrains the flexion fields. We test the AIM method using simulated data images with realistic noise and a variety of unlensed image properties, and show that it successfully reproduces the input flexion fields. We also apply the AIM method for flexion measurement to Hubble Space Telescope observations of A1689 and detect mass structure in the cluster using flexion measured with this method. We also estimate the scatter in the measured flexion fields due to the unlensed shape of the background galaxies and find values consistent with previous estimates.</TD>

OGLE UBVI phot. in Baade&quot;s Window (Paczynski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present UBVI photometry for 8530 stars in Baade&quot;s Window obtained during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. Among these are over one thousand red clump giants. 1391 of them have photometry with errors smaller than 0.04, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.20 mag in the I, V, B, and U-band, respectively. We constructed a map of interstellar reddening. The corrected colors of the red clump giants: (U-B)_0_, (B-V)_0_, and (V-I)_0_ are very well correlated, indicating that a single parameter determines the observed spread of their values, reaching almost 2mag in the (U-B)_0_. It seems most likely that heavy element content is the dominant parameter, but it is possible that another parameter: the age (or mass) of a star moves it along the same trajectory in the color-color diagram as the metallicity. The current ambiguity can be resolved with spectral analysis, and our catalog may be useful as a finding list of red clump giants. We point out that these K giants are more suitable for a fair determination of the distribution of metallicity than brighter M giants. We also present a compilation of UBVI data for 308 red clump giants near the Sun, for which Hipparcos parallaxes are more accurate than 10%. Spectral analysis of their metallicity may provide information about the local metallicity distribution as well as the extent to which mass (age) of these stars affects their colors.</TD>

Multiple lensed images in MCS J1206.2-0847 (Zitrin+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
As part of the CLASH program, MACS1206 was observed with HST from 2011 March to 2011 July. This is 1 of 25 clusters to be observed to a depth of 20 HST orbits in 16 filters with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS and IR cameras, and the ACS WFC. We obtain spectra for a number of multiple systems uncovered here, taken as part of the VLT/VIMOS Large Programme 186.A-0798, which will perform panoramic spectroscopy of 14 southern CLASH clusters, targeting hundreds of cluster members per cluster and SL features in their cores. The spectra presented here are the results of the very first observations for this program, consisting of four pointings with the LR-Blue grism, obtained in 2011 March-April, which yielded approximately 1000 redshifts. This configuration provides a spectral resolution of ~28{AA} with 1&dquot; slits and a useful wavelength coverage of 3700-6800{AA}.</TD>

<TD>
We present the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey-ARCS (SARCS) sample from the completed CFHTLS-WIDE and CFHTLS-DEEP covering a combined unmasked area of ~150deg^2^ in the sky. The lens sample is compiled through a semi-automatic technique consisting of using the ARCFINDER algorithm, followed by visual inspection and ranking of the candidates. We briefly described how ARCFINDER works (Alard 2006astro.ph..6757A) and the modifications implemented in the newer version of the algorithm.</TD>

Redshift survey in the Subaru GTO2deg^2^ field (Kurtz+, 2012)</TD>

Miyazaki et al. (2002ApJ...580L..97M, 2007, Cat. J/ApJ/669/714) used the 8.2m Subaru Telescope to carry out a weak-lensing survey of 13 well-separated fields covering a total of 21.82deg^2^. They used lensing convergence maps to identify 100 candidate halos with S/N {nu}&amp;gt;3.7; 10 of these candidates are within the GTO2deg^2^ field we examined here. We constructed the galaxy catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008, Cat. II/294) r-band galaxy list for the GTO2deg^2^ field. We acquired spectra for the objects with the Hectospec, a 300-fiber robotic instrument mounted on the MMT from 2009 February 1 to 2009 April 27. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3500-10000{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}.</TD>

Variable Stars in the Large Magellanic Clouds (MACHO, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
The MACHO Project is a collaboration between scientists at the Mt. Stromlo &amp;amp; Siding Spring Observatories, the Center for Particle Astrophysics at the Santa Barbara, San Diego, &amp;amp; Berkeley campuses of the University of California, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The primary aim of the project is a search for dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way in the form of objects like brown dwarfs or planets also named MACHOs, for MAssive Compact Halo Objects. The signature of these MACHOs is the occasional amplification of the light from extragalactic stars by the gravitational lens effect. The amplification can be large, but events are extremely rare: it is necessary to monitor photometrically several million stars for a period of years in order to obtain a useful detection rate. The MACHO project is described by Alcock et al. (1992, in &dquot;Robotic Telescopes in the 1990s&dquot;, A.V. Fillippenko Ed., ASP Conf. Series 34, p.193). A dedicated 1.27-m telescope at Mount Stromlo, Australia is used to obtain observations of the LMC year-round, using a camera imaging a field of view of 0.5 square degrees at prime focus. Photometric observations of the LMC fields are obtained in two bandpasses simultaneously, using a dichroic beamsplitter to direct the blue (440-590nm) and red (590-780nm) light onto 2x2 mosaics of 2048x2048 Loral CCDs; the 15um pixels map to 0.63arcsec on the sky. The photometric reduction methods are detailed in Alcock et al. (1996ApJ...461...84A).</TD>

Million Quasars Catalog (MILLIQUAS), Version 3.3 (7 April 2013)</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the Million Quasars (MILLIQUAS) Catalog, Version 3.3 (7 April 2013). It is a compendium of all type I QSOs, AGNe, and BL Lacs in the literature, up to 6 April 2013; completeness is full or nearly so. High-confidence (70+%) photometric SDSS and radio/X-ray associated objects are included, which bring the total number of objects to 1,246,268. Objects have been de-duplicated across catalogs, and the earliest name and best redshift is presented for each. Astrometry is fixed onto a combined APM/USNO-A/SDSS optical background, and is accurate to within 1-2 arcseconds in every case. Astrometric corrections from the author&quot;s paper (2013,PASA,30,4) are also included. Note that lensed images and close objects images within 1.5 arcseconds may be represented as single objects. This version has the following changes from the previous edition: &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; (1) Quasar data brought up to publications as at 6 April 2013. (2) Individual quasar data from 2013,A&amp;amp;A,551,A29 &dquot;Quasar Luminosity Function from dedicated SDSS-III and MMT data&dquot; by N. Palanque-Delabrouille et al, have been kindly provided by the lead author. This adds 713 new quasars. (3) SWIRE data is now included, consisting of 117 confirmed quasars and &amp;gt;20K photometric quasars from Rowan-Robinson M. et al, 2013,MNRAS,428,1958. (4) The author&quot;s paper 2013-PASA-30-4 marked 9 QSOs as uncertainly located. Of those: (a) The author has found Q 0112-27 at J011446.4-271408, via 1RXS J011446.4-271419. (b) XSF3:29 is found at J034116.3-435748, via 2RXP J034116.6-435754. (c) RXS J11167-1711 found at J111645.6-171155, via 1RXS J111644.6-171135. (d) 1H 0828-706 is removed as there are no credible candidates. (5) 26 SDSS-DR9 quasars removed as inspection shows they are only artifacts. (6) Iovino et al, 1996 A&amp;amp;AS,119,265 presented 1581 quasar spectra of which 144 were marked by them as questionable (&quot;?&quot;). Those 144 are often anomalously bright and none show radio/X-ray associations. Those 144 are now removed. (7) Eight blazars without redshift have been droNASA/GSFC HEASARC</TD>

OGLE variables in Galactic bar (Wray+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
Among over 200000 Galactic bulge variable stars in the public domain Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) catalogue, we found over 15000 red giant variables following two well-defined period-amplitude relations. The periods are in the range 10&amp;lt;P&amp;lt;100d, and amplitudes in the range 0.005&amp;lt;A&amp;lt;0.13mag in the I band. The variables cover a broad range of reddening-corrected colours, 1&amp;lt;(V-I)_0_&amp;lt;5, and a fairly narrow range of extinction-corrected apparent magnitudes, 10.5&amp;lt;I_0_&amp;lt;13. A subset of variables (type A) has an rms scatter of only 0.44mag. The average magnitudes for these stars are well correlated with the Galactic longitude, and vary from I_k,0_=11.82 for l=+8{deg} to I_k,0_=12.07 for l=-5{deg}, clearly indicating that they are located in the Galactic bar. Most variables have several oscillation periods.</TD>

OGLE2 Mira variables in the Galactic bulge (Matsunaga+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We have extracted a total of 1968 Mira variables from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II) data base in the Galactic bulge region. Among them, 1960 are associated with 2 Micron All-sky Survey (2MASS) sources, and 1541 are further identified with Midcourse Space Exploration (MSX) point sources. Their photometric properties are compared with those of Mira variables in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We have found that mass-losing stars with circumstellar matter are reddened such that the colour dependence of the absorption coefficient is similar to that of interstellar matter. We also discuss the structure of the bulge. The surface number density of the bulge Mira variables is well correlated with the 2.2-m surface brightness obtained by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. Using this relation, the total number of Mira variables in the bulge is estimated to be about 6x10^5^. The logP-K relation of the Mira variables gives their space distribution which supports the well-known asymmetry of the bar-like bulge.</TD>

VLBA calibrator survey: VCS1 catalog (Beasley+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
A catalog containing milli-arcsecond-accurate positions of 1332 extragalactic radio sources distributed over the northern sky is presented - the Very Long Baseline Array Calibrator Survey (VCS1). The positions have been derived from astrometric analysis of dual-frequency 2.3 and 8.4 GHz VLBA snapshot observations; in a majority of cases, images of the sources are also available. These radio sources are suitable for use in geodetic and astrometric experiments, and as phase-reference calibrators in high-sensitivity astronomical imaging. The VCS1 is the largest high-resolution radio survey ever undertaken and triples the number of sources available to the radio astronomy community for VLBI applications. In addition to the astrometric role, this survey can be used in active galactic nuclei, Galactic, gravitational lens, and cosmological studies.</TD>

Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (Buta+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
The Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) is a comprehensive compilation of diameters, axis ratios, relative bar position angles, and morphologies of inner and outer rings, pseudorings, and lenses in 3692 galaxies south of declination -17{deg}. The purpose of the catalog is to evaluate the idea that these ring phenomena are related to orbital resonances with a bar or oval in galaxy potentials. The catalog is based on visual inspection of most of the 606 fields of the Science Research Council (SRC) IIIa-J southern sky survey, with the ESO-B, ESO-R, and Palomar Sky surveys used as auxiliaries when needed for overexposed core regions. The catalog is most complete for SRC fields 1-303 (mostly south of declination -42{deg}). In addition to ringed galaxies, a list of 859 mostly nonringed galaxies intended for comparison with other catalogs is provided.</TD>

Massive galaxy clusters lensing analyse (Richard+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
High-resolution imaging data taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) or Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) instrument on HST are available for each selected cluster in one or two bands, either through our dedicated LoCuSS programme (GO-DD 11312, PI: G.P. Smith) or from the archive. J- and KS-band data were obtained between 2003 March and 2007 April on the following near-infrared instruments: Wide Infrared Camera (WIRC) on the Palomar-200-inch telescope, Infrared Side Port Imager (ISPI) on the CTIO Blanco 4-m telescope and Florida Infrared Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (FLAMINGOS) on the Kitt Peak (KPNO) 4-m telescope. We used the LRIS on the Keck-I telescope to perform long-slit and multislit observations of the clusters. The spectroscopic data used in the current paper are the outcome of six different observing runs between 2004 and 2008.</TD>

SDSS quasar lens search. II. (Inada+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We report the first results of our systematic search for strongly lensed quasars using the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Among 46420 quasars from the SDSS Data Release 3 (~4188deg^2^), we select a subsample of 22683 quasars that are located at redshifts between 0.6 and 2.2 and are brighter than the Galactic extinction-corrected i-band magnitude of 19.1. We identify 220 lens candidates from the quasar subsample, for which we conduct extensive and systematic follow-up observations in optical and near-infrared wavebands, in order to construct a complete lensed quasar sample at image separations between 1&dquot; and 20&dquot; and flux ratios of faint to bright lensed images larger than 10^-0.5^. We construct a statistical sample of 11 lensed quasars. Ten of these are galaxy-scale lenses with small image separations (~1&dquot;-2&dquot;) and one is a large separation (15&dquot;) system which is produced by a massive cluster of galaxies, representing the first statistical sample of lensed quasars including both galaxy- and cluster-scale lenses. The Data Release 3 spectroscopic quasars contain an additional 11 lensed quasars outside the statistical sample.</TD>

SDSS Quasar Lens Search. V. Final catalog (Inada+, 2012)</TD>

We start with the 105783 quasars in the SDSS-DR7 quasar catalog selected over 8000 deg^2^ (Schneider et al., 2010, Cat. VII/260, superseded by Cat. VII/269). Our selection (see Section 2) lead to a sample of 50836 source quasars. 174 new lensed quasar candidates were observed using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical imaging, near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. Together with the results we reported in Paper II (Inada et al., 2008, Cat. J/AJ/135/496) and Paper IV (Inada et al., 2010, Cat. J/AJ/140/403), we have constructed a statistical sample of 26 lensed quasar (table 5).</TD>

Gravitationally lensed arcs in the HST WFPC2 archive (Sand+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies located in the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 data archive. By carefully examining the images of 128 clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each of whose length-to-width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc candidates were identified with a length-to-width ratio of less than 7. Keck spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the radial arc sample from nonlensed objects is ~30%-50%.</TD>

Gravitational arc candidates in the CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey</TD>
<TD>
Candidate gravitational arcs in the 37 deg^2 of CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey (CARS). The data include their post-stamp images, astrometry, photometry (u*,g&quot;,r&quot;,i&quot;), geometric properties (length, length-to-width ratio, profile curvature, area), and photometric redshifts. The arc candidates were selected booth with an automatic arcfinder, based on a tailored image segmentation and a color selection, and by visually inspecting the survey.</TD>

Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum radio sample (Mckean+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We present the selection of the Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum (JBF) radio source sample, which is designed to reduce the uncertainties in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) gravitational lensing statistics arising from the lack of knowledge about the parent population luminosity function. From observations at 4.86GHz with the Very Large Array, we have selected a sample of 117 flat-spectrum radio sources with flux densities greater than 5mJy. These sources were selected in a similar manner to the CLASS complete sample and are therefore representative of the parent population at low flux densities. The vast majority (~90 per cent) of the JBF sample are found to be compact on the arcsec scales probed here and show little evidence of any extended radio jet emission. Using the JBF and CLASS complete samples, we find the differential number counts slope of the parent population above and below the CLASS 30-mJy flux density limit to be 2.07+/-0.02 and 1.96+/-0.12, respectively.</TD>

VRc observations of LMC long-period red variables (Noda+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
146 long-period red variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the three-year Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) project data base were analysed. A careful periodic analysis was performed on these stars and a catalogue of their magnitudes, colours, periods and amplitudes is presented. We convert our blue and red magnitudes to K-band values using 19 oxygen-rich stars. A group of red short-period stars separated from the Mira sequence has been found on a (log P,K) diagram. They are located at the short period side of the Mira sequence consistent with the work of Wood &amp;amp; Sebo (1996MNRAS.282..958W). There are two interpretations for such stars; a difference in pulsation mode or a difference in chemical composition. We investigated the properties of these stars together with their colour, amplitude and periodicity. We conclude that they have small amplitudes and less regular variability. They are likely to be higher-mode pulsators. A large scatter has also been found on the long-period side of the (logP,K) diagram. This is possibly a systematic spread given that the blue band of our photometric system covers both standard B and V bands and affects carbon-rich stars.</TD>

OGLE microlensing events in Galactic Bulge (Udalski+, 2000)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of microlensing events detected toward the Galactic bulge in three observing seasons, 1997-1999, during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The search for microlensing events was performed using a database of about 4x10^9^ photometric measurements of about 20.5 million stars from the Galactic bulge. The Catalog comprises 214 microlensing events found in the fields covering about 11 square degrees on the sky and distributed in different parts of the Galactic bulge. The sample includes 20 binary microlensing events, 14 of them are caustic crossing. In one case a double star is likely lensed. We present distribution of the basic parameters of microlensing events and show preliminary rate of microlensing in different regions of the Galactic bulge. The latter reveals clear dependence on the Galactic coordinates. The dependence on l indicates that the majority of lenses toward the Galactic bulge are located in the Galactic bar. Models of the Galactic bar seem to reasonably predict the observed spatial distribution of microlensing events in the Galactic bulge. All data presented in the Catalog and photometry of all events are available from the OGLE Internet archive.</TD>

QSO-candidates in OGLE-II Galactic bulge fields (Sumi+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present 97 QSO candidates in 48 Galactic bulge fields of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II) covering ~11deg^2^, which are selected via their variability. We extend light curves of variable objects which were detected in a 3-yr baseline in the OGLE-II variable star catalogue to fourth year. We search for objects that are faint (16&amp;lt;I_0_&amp;lt;18.5) and slowly variable over 4-yr in this catalogue by using the variogram/structure function. Finding the QSOs in such stellar-crowded and high extinction fields is challenging, but should be useful for the astrometric reference frame. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are required to confirm these QSO candidates. Follow-up observations are being prepared for four of these fields (BUL_SC1, 2, 32 and 45). Follow-up observations for other fields are strongly encouraged. The complete list and light curves of all 97 candidates are available in electronic format at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/sumi/QSO-OGLEII/ .</TD>

OGLE RR Lyrae VI photometry (Udalski, 1998)</TD>
<TD>
We analyze the mean luminosity of three samples of field RRab Lyr stars observed in the course of the OGLE microlensing experiment: 73 stars from the Galactic bulge and 110 and 128 stars from selected fields in the LMC and SMC, respectively. The fields are the same as in the recent distance determination to the Magellanic Clouds with the red clump stars method by Udalski et al. (1998AcA....48....1U). We determine the relative distance scale Galactic Bulge: 0.194+/-0.010; LMC: 1.00 ; SMC: 1.30+/-0.08. We calibrate our RR Lyr distance scale with the recent calibration of Gould and Popowski (1998ApJ...508..844G) based on statistical parallaxes. We obtain the following distance moduli to the Galactic bulge, LMC and SMC: m-M=14.5+/-0.15, m-M=18.09+/-0.16 and m-M=18.66+/-0.16mag.</TD>

ACO 370, 2218 and 2390 fluxes at 7 and 15um (Metcalfe+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
ESA&quot;s Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) was used to perform a deep survey with ISOCAM through three massive gravitationally lensing clusters of galaxies. The total area surveyed depends on source flux, with nearly seventy square arcminutes covered for the brighter flux levels in maps centred on the three clusters Abell 370, Abell 2218 and Abell 2390. We present maps and photometry at 6.7um (hereafter 7um) and 14.3um (hereafter 15um), showing a total of 145 mid-infrared sources and the associated source counts.</TD>

Submm observations in gravitational lenses (Knudsen+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We have conducted a submillimetre mapping survey of faint, gravitationally lensed sources, where we have targeted 12 galaxy clusters and additionally the New Technology Telescope (NTT) Deep Field. The total area surveyed is 71.5arcmin^2^ in the image plane; correcting for gravitational lensing, the total area surveyed is 40arcmin^2^ in the source plane for a typical source redshift z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;2.5. In the deepest maps, an image plane depth of 1{sigma} rms ~0.8mJy is reached. This survey is the largest survey to date to reach such depths. In total 59 sources were detected, including three multiply imaged sources. The gravitational lensing makes it possible to detect sources with flux density below the blank field confusion limit. The lensing-corrected fluxes range from 0.11 to 19mJy. After correcting for multiplicity, there are 10 sources with fluxes &amp;lt;2mJy of which seven have submJy fluxes, doubling the number of such sources known. Number counts are determined below the confusion limit. At 1mJy, the integrated number count is ~10^4^deg^-2^, and at 0.5mJy it is ~2x10^4^deg^-2^. Based on the number counts, at a source plan flux limit of 0.1mJy, essentially all of the 850-m background emission has been resolved. The dominant contribution (&amp;gt;50 per cent) to the integrated background arises from sources with fluxes S850 between 0.4 and 2.5mJy, while the bright sources S850&amp;gt;6mJy contribute only 10 per cent.</TD>

OGLE2 Mira variables in the Galactic bulge (Matsunaga+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We have extracted a total of 1968 Mira variables from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II) data base in the Galactic bulge region. Among them, 1960 are associated with 2 Micron All-sky Survey (2MASS) sources, and 1541 are further identified with Midcourse Space Exploration (MSX) point sources. Their photometric properties are compared with those of Mira variables in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We have found that mass-losing stars with circumstellar matter are reddened such that the colour dependence of the absorption coefficient is similar to that of interstellar matter. We also discuss the structure of the bulge. The surface number density of the bulge Mira variables is well correlated with the 2.2-m surface brightness obtained by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. Using this relation, the total number of Mira variables in the bulge is estimated to be about 6x10^5^. The logP-K relation of the Mira variables gives their space distribution which supports the well-known asymmetry of the bar-like bulge.</TD>

Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (Buta+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
The Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) is a comprehensive compilation of diameters, axis ratios, relative bar position angles, and morphologies of inner and outer rings, pseudorings, and lenses in 3692 galaxies south of declination -17{deg}. The purpose of the catalog is to evaluate the idea that these ring phenomena are related to orbital resonances with a bar or oval in galaxy potentials. The catalog is based on visual inspection of most of the 606 fields of the Science Research Council (SRC) IIIa-J southern sky survey, with the ESO-B, ESO-R, and Palomar Sky surveys used as auxiliaries when needed for overexposed core regions. The catalog is most complete for SRC fields 1-303 (mostly south of declination -42{deg}). In addition to ringed galaxies, a list of 859 mostly nonringed galaxies intended for comparison with other catalogs is provided.</TD>

CRATES [2]</TD>
<TD>
CRATES Flat-Spectrum Radio Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
The authors have assembled an 8.4 GHz survey of bright, flat-spectrum (alpha &amp;gt; -0.5) radio sources with nearly uniform extragalactic (|b| &amp;gt; 10 degrees) coverage for sources brighter than a 4.8 GHz flux density S_4.8GHz = 65 mJy. The catalog is assembled from existing observations (especially the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey, CLASS, and the Wright et al. PMN-CA survey), augmented by reprocessing of archival VLA and ATCA data and by new observations to fill in coverage gaps. The authors refer to this program as CRATES, the Combined Radio All-Sky Targeted Eight-GHz Survey. The resulting catalog provides precise positions, subarcsecond structures, and spectral indices for some 11,000 sources. The authors describe the morphology and spectral index distribution of the sample and comment on the survey&quot;s power to select several classes of interesting sources, especially high-energy blazars. Comparison of CRATES with other high-frequency surveys also provides unique opportunities for identification of high-power radio sources. This table contains 14467 entries, where each entry corresponds to an 8.4-GHz counterpart source (or absence thereof) to one of 11,131 4.8-GHz sources. The number of entries exceeds the number of 4.8-GHz sources because there are many cases in which there are multiple (from 2 - 20) 8.4-GHz counterparts to a single 4.8-GHz source. There are also 762 entries in which no 8.4-GHz counterpart was detected (morph_type = &quot;N&quot;).</TD>

We start with the 105783 quasars in the SDSS-DR7 quasar catalog selected over 8000 deg^2^ (Schneider et al., 2010, Cat. VII/260, superseded by Cat. VII/269). Our selection (see Section 2) lead to a sample of 50836 source quasars. 174 new lensed quasar candidates were observed using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical imaging, near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. Together with the results we reported in Paper II (Inada et al., 2008, Cat. J/AJ/135/496) and Paper IV (Inada et al., 2010, Cat. J/AJ/140/403), we have constructed a statistical sample of 26 lensed quasar (table 5).</TD>

SDSS quasar lens search. II. (Inada+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We report the first results of our systematic search for strongly lensed quasars using the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Among 46420 quasars from the SDSS Data Release 3 (~4188deg^2^), we select a subsample of 22683 quasars that are located at redshifts between 0.6 and 2.2 and are brighter than the Galactic extinction-corrected i-band magnitude of 19.1. We identify 220 lens candidates from the quasar subsample, for which we conduct extensive and systematic follow-up observations in optical and near-infrared wavebands, in order to construct a complete lensed quasar sample at image separations between 1&dquot; and 20&dquot; and flux ratios of faint to bright lensed images larger than 10^-0.5^. We construct a statistical sample of 11 lensed quasars. Ten of these are galaxy-scale lenses with small image separations (~1&dquot;-2&dquot;) and one is a large separation (15&dquot;) system which is produced by a massive cluster of galaxies, representing the first statistical sample of lensed quasars including both galaxy- and cluster-scale lenses. The Data Release 3 spectroscopic quasars contain an additional 11 lensed quasars outside the statistical sample.</TD>

OGLE high proper motion stars towards MC (Soszynski+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of high proper motion (HPM) stars detected in the foreground of central parts of the Magellanic Clouds. The Catalog contains 2161 objects in the 4.5 square degree area towards the LMC, and 892 HPM stars in the 2.4 square degree area towards the SMC. The Catalog is based on observations collected during four years of the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the images provided candidate HPM stars with proper motion as small as 4mas/yr. These appeared as pseudo-variables, and were all measured astrometrically on all CCD images, providing typically about 400 data points per star. The reference frame was defined by the majority of background stars, most of them members of the Magellanic Clouds. The reflex motion due to solar velocity with respect to the local standards of rest is clearly seen. The largest proper motion in our sample is 363mas/yr. Parallaxes were measured with errors smaller than 20% for several stars.</TD>

OGLEII high pm stars towards Galactic Centre (Rattenbury+, 2008)</TD>

The photometry data base of the second phase of the OGLE microlensing experiment, OGLE-II, is a rich source of information about the kinematics and structure of the Galaxy. In this work, we use the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue to identify candidate stars which have high proper motions. 521 stars with proper motion {mu}&amp;gt;50mas/yr in the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue were cross-identified with stars in the MACHO high proper motion catalogue, and the DEep Near-Infrared Survey and Two-Micron All-Sky Survey infrared photometry catalogues. Photometric distances were computed for stars with colours consistent with G/K- and M-type stars. Six stars were newly identified as possible nearby (&amp;lt;50pc) M dwarfs.</TD>

Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum radio sample (Mckean+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We present the selection of the Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum (JBF) radio source sample, which is designed to reduce the uncertainties in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) gravitational lensing statistics arising from the lack of knowledge about the parent population luminosity function. From observations at 4.86GHz with the Very Large Array, we have selected a sample of 117 flat-spectrum radio sources with flux densities greater than 5mJy. These sources were selected in a similar manner to the CLASS complete sample and are therefore representative of the parent population at low flux densities. The vast majority (~90 per cent) of the JBF sample are found to be compact on the arcsec scales probed here and show little evidence of any extended radio jet emission. Using the JBF and CLASS complete samples, we find the differential number counts slope of the parent population above and below the CLASS 30-mJy flux density limit to be 2.07+/-0.02 and 1.96+/-0.12, respectively.</TD>

Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS) Point Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This study presents the first set of maps and band-merged catalog from the Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS). Observations at 250, 350, and 500 micron (um) were taken with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instrument onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. HerS covers 79 square degrees along the SDSS Stripe 82 to an average depth of 13.0, 12.9, and 14.8 mJy beam&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (including confusion) at 250, 350, and 500 um, respectively. HerS was designed to measure correlations with external tracers of the dark matter density field, either point-like (i.e., galaxies selected from radio to X-ray) or extended (i.e., clusters and gravitational lensing), in order to measure the bias and redshift distribution of intensities of infrared-emitting dusty star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. By locating HerS in Stripe 82, the authors maximize the overlap with available and upcoming cosmological surveys. The band-merged catalog contains 3.3 x 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; sources detected at a significance of &amp;amp;gt;~ 3 sigma (including confusion noise). The maps and catalog are available at &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/&dquot;&amp;gt;http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This table contains the first HerS band-merged point source catalog based on observations covering 79 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; in the equatorial Stripe 82, spanning 13 to 37 degrees (0&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 54&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to 2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 24&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; ) in RA, and -2 to +2 degrees in Declination. The SPIRE beams are 18.1, 25.2 and 36.6 arcseconds at 250, 350 and 500 um, respectively. The band-merged catalog was constructed, after filtering, with DESPHOT (Roseboom et al. 2010, MNRAS, 409, 48), using 250-um sources (extracted with STARFINDER: Diolaiti et al. 2000, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 147, 335) as positional priors.

Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (Buta+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
The Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) is a comprehensive compilation of diameters, axis ratios, relative bar position angles, and morphologies of inner and outer rings, pseudorings, and lenses in 3692 galaxies south of declination -17{deg}. The purpose of the catalog is to evaluate the idea that these ring phenomena are related to orbital resonances with a bar or oval in galaxy potentials. The catalog is based on visual inspection of most of the 606 fields of the Science Research Council (SRC) IIIa-J southern sky survey, with the ESO-B, ESO-R, and Palomar Sky surveys used as auxiliaries when needed for overexposed core regions. The catalog is most complete for SRC fields 1-303 (mostly south of declination -42{deg}). In addition to ringed galaxies, a list of 859 mostly nonringed galaxies intended for comparison with other catalogs is provided.</TD>

OGLE-II DIA microlensing events (Wozniak+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
We present a sample of microlensing events discovered in the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the OGLE-II images collected during three observing seasons, 1997-1999. 4424 light curves pass our criteria on the presence of a brightening episode on top of a constant baseline. Among those, 512 candidate microlensing events were selected visually. We designed an automated procedure, which unambiguously selects up to 237 best events. Including eight candidate events recovered by other means, a total of 520 light curves are presented in this work.</TD>

For each spectral line we give the lower excitation potential, measured equivalent widths, and derived absolute abundances. We also give median abundances for each star, normalised to the Sun, and errors in the median abundances. These tables contain data for the last 12 microlensed dwarf stars. Data for the first 14 microlensed dwarfs can be found in Bensby et al. (2009, Cat. J/A+A/499/737) and Bensby et al. (2010, Cat. J/A+A/512/A41).</TD>

SDSS Quasar Lens Search. IV. (Inada+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
The 136 lensed quasar candidates taken from the 13,636 quasars constitute our targets for follow-up observations, but we remove two candidates that have already been examined. One is the morphologically selected candidate SDSS J111816.95+074558.1 which is the well-known lensed quasar PG1115+080 (Weymann et al. 1980Natur.285..641W). The other is the color-selected candidate SDSS J165502.02+260516.5, which is a pair of quasars with slightly different redshifts from SDSS spectroscopy. The remaining 134 candidates were observed as described in what follows using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical and/or near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 2 and 3.</TD>

Australia Telescope 20-GHz (AT20G) High-Angular Resolution Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the high-angular-resolution catalog for the Australia Telescope 20-GHz (AT20G) survey, using the high-angular-resolution 6-km antenna data at the baselines of ~4500 m of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The authors have used the data to produce the visibility catalog that separates the compact active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the extended radio sources at the 0.15-arcsecond angular scale, corresponding to the linear size scale of 1 kpc at redshifts higher than 0.7. They find the radio population at 20 GHz to be dominated by compact AGNs constituting 77% of the total sources in the AT20G. In the paper, they introduce the visibility-spectra diagnostic plot, produced using the AT20G cross-matches with lower frequency radio surveys at 1 GHz [the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS: Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693) and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS: Mauch et al. 2003, MNRAS, 342, 1117)], that separates the 20-GHz population into distinct sub-populations of the compact AGNs, the compact steep-spectrum (CSS) sources, the extended AGN-powered sources and extended flat-spectrum sources. The extended flat-spectrum sources include a local thermal emitting population of high-latitude planetary nebulae and also gravitational lens and binary black hole candidates among the AGNs. The authors find a smooth transition in properties between the CSS sources and the AGN populations. The visibility catalog, together with the main AT20G survey, provides an estimate of angular size scales for sources in the AT20G and an estimate of the flux arising from central cores of extended radio sources. The identification of the compact AGNs in the AT20G survey provides high-quality calibrators for high-frequency radio telescope arrays and very large baseline interferometry observations.</TD>

Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (12th Ed.) (Veron+ 2006)</TD>
<TD>
This catalogue is an update of the previous versions; as in the previous editions no information about absorption lines of X-ray properties are given, but absolute magnitudes are given, assuming Ho=50km/s/Mpc and q_0_=0. In this edition the 20cm radio flux is listed when available, in place of the 11cm flux. The present edition of this catalogue contains the quasars with measured redshift known prior to January 1st, 2006. It contains 85221 quasars, 1122 BL Lac objects and 21737 active galaxies (including 9628 Seyfert 1s), almost doubling the number listed in the 11th edition. Lists of known lensed quasars (table2.dat) and double quasars (table3.dat) are also given here.</TD>

Photometric masses of early-type lens galaxies (Grillo+, 2009)</TD>

We fit the lens spectral energy distributions (SEDs) consisting of ugriz magnitudes with a three-parameter grid (age, star-formation timescale, and photometric mass) of Bruzual &amp;amp; Charlot&quot;s (2003MNRAS.344.1000B) and Maraston&quot;s (2005MNRAS.362..799M) composite stellar-population models, computed by adopting solar metallicity and various initial mass functions (IMFs). We also utilize the best-fit parameters derived from the lens models of the total projected mass enclosed within the disk defined by the Einstein radius of each system.</TD>

OGLE UBVI phot. in Baade&quot;s Window (Paczynski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present UBVI photometry for 8530 stars in Baade&quot;s Window obtained during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. Among these are over one thousand red clump giants. 1391 of them have photometry with errors smaller than 0.04, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.20 mag in the I, V, B, and U-band, respectively. We constructed a map of interstellar reddening. The corrected colors of the red clump giants: (U-B)_0_, (B-V)_0_, and (V-I)_0_ are very well correlated, indicating that a single parameter determines the observed spread of their values, reaching almost 2mag in the (U-B)_0_. It seems most likely that heavy element content is the dominant parameter, but it is possible that another parameter: the age (or mass) of a star moves it along the same trajectory in the color-color diagram as the metallicity. The current ambiguity can be resolved with spectral analysis, and our catalog may be useful as a finding list of red clump giants. We point out that these K giants are more suitable for a fair determination of the distribution of metallicity than brighter M giants. We also present a compilation of UBVI data for 308 red clump giants near the Sun, for which Hipparcos parallaxes are more accurate than 10%. Spectral analysis of their metallicity may provide information about the local metallicity distribution as well as the extent to which mass (age) of these stars affects their colors.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We argue that globular clusters (GCs) are good candidates for gravitational lenses in explaining quasar-galaxy associations. The catalog of associations (Bukhmastova, 2001, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AZh/78/675&amp;gt;) compiled from the LEDA catalog of galaxies (Paturel, 1997A&amp;amp;AS..124..109P) and from the catalog of quasars (Veron-Cetty and Vero, 1998, see Cat. &amp;lt;VII/235&amp;gt;) is used. Based on the new catalog, we show that one might expect an increased number of GCs around irregular galaxies of types 9 and 10 from the hypothesis that distant compact sources are gravitationally lensed by GCs in the halos of foreground galaxies. The King model is used to determine the central surface densities of 135 GCs in the Milky Way. The distribution of GCs in central surface density was found to be lognormal.</TD>

QSO luminosity function at z~4 (Glikman+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We make use of publicly available deep imaging data from the NDWFS (NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey) in the Bootes field from the DR3 (B_W_,R,I bands) and from the DLS (Deep Lens Survey; DR3 in B,V,R and z&quot; bands). DLS is closely related to the NDWFS in that the optical imaging has been obtained on the same 4m Mayall Telescope (at KPNO) and Blanco Telescope (at CTIO) using the same wide-field optical imagers Mosaic-I and Mosaic-II as the NDWFS. We obtained 28 spectra for the DLS and NDWFS candidates and found 23 high-redshift quasars (the remaining objects were three Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3.9, one Type-II active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z~0.2 and one featureless, unidentified spectrum). All but two of our spectra were taken with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea. Five quasars were discovered on UT 2005 November 28 and 29. Only the red camera was used, with the 400lines/mm grating blazed at 8500{AA}. Sixteen additional quasars were discovered during a run on UT 2006 May 20-22. Two additional spectra were taken on UT 2006 March 25 and 26 with the Multi-Aperture Red Spectrometer (MARS) on the Mayall 4m telescope at Kitt Peak.</TD>

We present the Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars in the Galactic Bulge. The Catalog is based on observations collected during the OGLE (Optical Graviational Lensing Experiment) microlensing search: (1) 213 periodic variable stars brighter than Imag=18mag: 31 pulsating, 116 eclipsing and 66 miscellaneous type variables from the Baade&quot;s Window BWC field are presented. (2) 800 variable stars found in four Baade&quot;s Window fields BW1, BW2, BW3 and BW4 are presented. Among them 71 are classified as pulsating, 465 as eclipsing and 264 as miscellaneous type. (3) 644 variable stars: 64 pulsating, 352 eclipsing and 228 miscellaneous type were detected in four Baade&quot;s Window fields BW5, BW6, BW7 and BW8. Analysis of periodic variable stars found in overlapping regions of the Baade&quot;s Window fields yields an average completeness of the Catalog equal to about 80% of periodic variables objects registered in the OGLE databases and about 65% of all periodic variable stars in the observed region of the sky. (4) 631 variable stars: 59 pulsating, 348 eclipsing and 224 miscellaneous type were detected in third Baade&quot;s Window fields BW9, BW10, and BW11. (5) 574 variables stars: 44 pulsating, 369 eclipsing and 161 miscellaneous type were detected in four fields located symmetrically in the galactic latitude around the Galactic center: MM5-A, MM5-B, MM7-A and MM7-B.</TD>

SDSS Quasar Lens Search. V. Final catalog (Inada+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We start with the 105783 quasars in the SDSS-DR7 quasar catalog selected over 8000 deg^2^ (Schneider et al., 2010, Cat. VII/260, superseded by Cat. VII/269). Our selection (see Section 2) lead to a sample of 50836 source quasars. 174 new lensed quasar candidates were observed using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical imaging, near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. Together with the results we reported in Paper II (Inada et al., 2008, Cat. J/AJ/135/496) and Paper IV (Inada et al., 2010, Cat. J/AJ/140/403), we have constructed a statistical sample of 26 lensed quasar (table 5).</TD>

CRATES [3]</TD>
<TD>
CRATES Flat-Spectrum Radio Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
The authors have assembled an 8.4 GHz survey of bright, flat-spectrum (alpha &amp;gt; -0.5) radio sources with nearly uniform extragalactic (|b| &amp;gt; 10 degrees) coverage for sources brighter than a 4.8 GHz flux density S_4.8GHz = 65 mJy. The catalog is assembled from existing observations (especially the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey, CLASS, and the Wright et al. PMN-CA survey), augmented by reprocessing of archival VLA and ATCA data and by new observations to fill in coverage gaps. The authors refer to this program as CRATES, the Combined Radio All-Sky Targeted Eight-GHz Survey. The resulting catalog provides precise positions, subarcsecond structures, and spectral indices for some 11,000 sources. The authors describe the morphology and spectral index distribution of the sample and comment on the survey&quot;s power to select several classes of interesting sources, especially high-energy blazars. Comparison of CRATES with other high-frequency surveys also provides unique opportunities for identification of high-power radio sources. This table contains 14467 entries, where each entry corresponds to an 8.4-GHz counterpart source (or absence thereof) to one of 11,131 4.8-GHz sources. The number of entries exceeds the number of 4.8-GHz sources because there are many cases in which there are multiple (from 2 - 20) 8.4-GHz counterparts to a single 4.8-GHz source. There are also 762 entries in which no 8.4-GHz counterpart was detected (morph_type = &quot;N&quot;).</TD>

OGLEII high pm stars towards Galactic Centre (Rattenbury+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
The photometry data base of the second phase of the OGLE microlensing experiment, OGLE-II, is a rich source of information about the kinematics and structure of the Galaxy. In this work, we use the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue to identify candidate stars which have high proper motions. 521 stars with proper motion {mu}&amp;gt;50mas/yr in the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue were cross-identified with stars in the MACHO high proper motion catalogue, and the DEep Near-Infrared Survey and Two-Micron All-Sky Survey infrared photometry catalogues. Photometric distances were computed for stars with colours consistent with G/K- and M-type stars. Six stars were newly identified as possible nearby (&amp;lt;50pc) M dwarfs.</TD>

Log of Subaru Prime Focus Camera Exposures (ADAC NAOJ, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
This database contains a log of the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) exposures since April 2001. The data are regularly updated, and the last date of the log is written in &dquot;File Summary&dquot;. Note that from this version of Nov. 2005, the data number is largely increased because those data with worse position determination (up to 30 arcsec error) are included. Suprime-Cam is an 80-mega pixels (10240 x 8192) mosaic CCD camera, for the wide-field prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34&quot;x27&quot;, a unique facility among the 8-10m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0&dquot;.202 per pixel. The focal plane consists of ten high- resistivity 2kx2k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which are cooled by a large Stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. A filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type is designed that can hold up to ten large filters (205x170x15mm^3^). The wide-field corrector is basically a three-lens Wynne- type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector. The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of 30&quot; in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller than 30um peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image over the entire field. The median seeing in the I_c-band, measured over one year and a half, is 0&dquot;.61. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the time of commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging. For details, see: Miyazaki et al., Publ. Astron. Soc. Japan 54, 833-853, 2002 (2002PASJ...54..833M)</TD>

We observed a sample of 26 clusters with the Frederick C. Gillett Telescope (Gemini North) between 2008 February and 2010 June as part of Gemini programs GN-2008A-Q-25 and GN-2009A-Q-21. We obtained pre-imaging of 20 of the 26 clusters in gri with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). In addition to the Gemini/GMOS-North spectroscopy, we supplement our data set with cluster member redshift measurements made at the 3.5m Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) Telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, using the Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) in long-slit mode.</TD>

The BAX Database (Blanchard+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
We present BAX, Base de Donnees Amas de Galaxies X (http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr), a multi-wavelength database dedicated to X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies allowing detailed information retrieval. BAX is designed to support astronomical research by providing access to published measurements of the main physical quantities and to the related bibliographic references: basic data stored in the database are cluster/group identifiers, equatorial coordinates, redshift, flux, X-ray luminosity (in the ROSAT band) and temperature, and links to additional linked parameters (in X-rays, such as spatial profile parameters, as well as SZ parameters of the hot gas, lensing measurements, and data at other wavelengths, such as optical and radio). The clusters and groups in BAX can be queried by the basic parameters as well as the linked parameters or combinations of these. We expect BAX to become an important tool for the astronomical community. BAX will optimize various aspects of the scientific analysis of X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies, from proposal planning to data collection, interpretation and publication, from both ground based facilities like MEGACAM (CFHT), VIRMOS (VLT) and space missions like XMM-Newton, Chandra and Planck.</TD>

Detailed morphology of SDSS galaxies (Nair+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of detailed visual classifications for 14034 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4, Cat. &amp;lt;II/267&amp;gt;). Our sample includes nearly all spectroscopically targeted galaxies in the redshift range 0.01&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.1 down to an apparent extinction-corrected limit of g&amp;lt;16mag. In addition to T-Types, we record the existence of bars, rings, lenses, tails, warps, dust lanes, arm flocculence, and multiplicity. This sample defines a comprehensive local galaxy sample which we will use in future papers to study low-redshift morphology. It will also prove useful for calibrating automated galaxy classification algorithms. In this paper, we describe the classification methodology used, detail the systematics and biases of our sample, and summarize the overall statistical properties of the sample, noting the most obvious trends that are relevant for general comparisons of our catalog with previously published work.</TD>

Gravitationally lensed arcs in the HST WFPC2 archive (Sand+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies located in the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 data archive. By carefully examining the images of 128 clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each of whose length-to-width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc candidates were identified with a length-to-width ratio of less than 7. Keck spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the radial arc sample from nonlensed objects is ~30%-50%.</TD>

VRc observations of LMC long-period red variables (Noda+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
146 long-period red variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the three-year Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) project data base were analysed. A careful periodic analysis was performed on these stars and a catalogue of their magnitudes, colours, periods and amplitudes is presented. We convert our blue and red magnitudes to K-band values using 19 oxygen-rich stars. A group of red short-period stars separated from the Mira sequence has been found on a (log P,K) diagram. They are located at the short period side of the Mira sequence consistent with the work of Wood &amp;amp; Sebo (1996MNRAS.282..958W). There are two interpretations for such stars; a difference in pulsation mode or a difference in chemical composition. We investigated the properties of these stars together with their colour, amplitude and periodicity. We conclude that they have small amplitudes and less regular variability. They are likely to be higher-mode pulsators. A large scatter has also been found on the long-period side of the (logP,K) diagram. This is possibly a systematic spread given that the blue band of our photometric system covers both standard B and V bands and affects carbon-rich stars.</TD>

BVI photometry of OGLE LMC Cepheids (Udalski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of Cepheids from the LMC. The Catalog contains 1333 objects detected in the 4.5 square degree area of central parts of the LMC. About 3.4*10^5^ BVI measurements of these stars were collected during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Catalog data include period, BVI photometry, astrometry, and R_21_, phi_21_ parameters of the Fourier decomposition of I-band light curve. The vast majority of objects from the Catalog are the classical Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode. The remaining objects include Population II Cepheids and red giants with pulsation-like light curves. Tests of completeness performed in overlapping parts of adjacent fields indicate that completeness of the Catalog is very high: &amp;gt;96%. Statistics and distributions of basic parameters of Cepheids are also presented. Finally, we show the light curves of three eclipsing systems containing Cepheid detected among objects of the Catalog. All presented data, including individual BVI observations are available from the OGLE Internet archive at URL: ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/var_stars/lmc/cep/catalog/</TD>

OGLE SMC BVI photometry (Udalski+ 1998)</TD>
<TD>
We present three color, BVI maps of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The maps contain precise photometric and astrometric data for about 2.2million stars from the central regions of the SMC bar covering ~2.4 square degrees on the sky. Mean brightness of stars is derived from observations collected in the course of the OGLE-II microlensing search from about 130, 30 and 15 measurements in the I, V and B-bands, respectively. Accuracy of the zero points of photometry is about 0.01mag, and astrometry 0.15arcsec (with possible systematic error up to 0.7arcsec). Color magnitude diagrams of observed fields are also presented. The maps of the SMC are the first from the series of similar maps covering other OGLE fields: LMC, Galactic bulge and Galactic disk. The data are very well suited for many projects, particularly for the SMC which has been neglected photometrically for years.</TD>

The CLASS blazar survey. I. (Marcha+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
This paper presents a new complete and well-defined sample of flat-spectrum radio sources (FSRS) selected from the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS), with the further constraint of a bright (mag&amp;lt;=17.5) optical counterpart. The sample has been designed to produce a large number of low-luminosity blazars in order to test the current unifying models in the low-luminosity regime. In this first paper the new sample is presented and the radio properties of the 325 sources contained therein are discussed.</TD>

OGLE variables in Galactic bar (Wray+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
Among over 200000 Galactic bulge variable stars in the public domain Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) catalogue, we found over 15000 red giant variables following two well-defined period-amplitude relations. The periods are in the range 10&amp;lt;P&amp;lt;100d, and amplitudes in the range 0.005&amp;lt;A&amp;lt;0.13mag in the I band. The variables cover a broad range of reddening-corrected colours, 1&amp;lt;(V-I)_0_&amp;lt;5, and a fairly narrow range of extinction-corrected apparent magnitudes, 10.5&amp;lt;I_0_&amp;lt;13. A subset of variables (type A) has an rms scatter of only 0.44mag. The average magnitudes for these stars are well correlated with the Galactic longitude, and vary from I_k,0_=11.82 for l=+8{deg} to I_k,0_=12.07 for l=-5{deg}, clearly indicating that they are located in the Galactic bar. Most variables have several oscillation periods.</TD>

OGLE: Gaia South Ecliptic Pole Field (Soszynski+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Gaia South Ecliptic Pole (GSEP) field, 5.3 square degrees area around the South Ecliptic Pole on the outskirts of the LMC, based on the data collected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, OGLE-IV. The GSEP field will be observed during the commissioning phase of the ESA Gaia space mission for testing and calibrating the Gaia instruments. We provide the photometric maps of the GSEP region containing the mean VI photometry of all detected stellar objects and their equatorial coordinates. We show the quality and completeness of the OGLE-IV photometry and color-magnitude diagrams of this region. We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing variables. Several objects deserving special attention were also selected, including a new classical Cepheid in a binary eclipsing system.</TD>

Planck submillimetre sources in Virgo Cluster (Baes+, 2014)</TD>
<TD>
We cross-correlate the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS) with the fully sampled 84deg^2^ Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) fields. We search for and identify the 857 and 545GHz PCCS sources in the HeViCS fields by studying their FIR/submm and optical counterparts. We find 84 and 48 compact Planck sources in the HeViCS fields at 857 and 545GHz, respectively. Almost all sources correspond to individual bright Virgo Cluster galaxies. The vast majority of the Planck detected galaxies are late-type spirals, with the Sc class dominating the numbers, while early-type galaxies are virtually absent from the sample, especially at 545GHz. We compare the HeViCS SPIRE flux densities for the detected galaxies with the four different PCCS flux density estimators and find an excellent correlation with the aperture photometry flux densities, even at the highest flux density levels. We find only seven PCCS sources in the HeViCS fields without a nearby galaxy as obvious counterpart, and conclude that all of these are dominated by Galactic cirrus features or are spurious detections. No Planck sources in the HeViCS fields seem to be associated to high-redshift proto-clusters of dusty galaxies or strongly lensed submm sources. Finally, our study is the first empirical confirmation of the simulation-based estimated completeness of the PCCS, and provides a strong support of the internal PCCS validation procedure.</TD>

Massive clusters in the LMC (Baumgardt+, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
We use four recent compilations of LMC star cluster parameters to derive a combined catalogue for LMC clusters. Our first catalogue is the recent work of Glatt et al. (2010, Cat. J/A+A/517/A50), who used data from the MCPS together with isochrone fitting to derive ages and luminosities for 1193 populous star clusters in a 64deg^2^ area of the LMC. The second data set that we use is the catalogue of Pietrzynski &amp;amp; Udalski (2200, Cat. J/AcA/50/337), who used BVI data from the OGLE II microlensing experiment (Udalski et al., 1998, Cat, J/AcA/48/147) together with isochrone fitting to derive ages of about 600 star clusters which are located in the central parts of the LMC and are younger than 1.2Gyr. Our third catalogue is the cluster catalogue presented by Hunter et al. (2003AJ....126.1836H). The Hunter et al. catalogue contains data for about 746 different LMC clusters, limited to the inner regions of the LMC and to absolute luminosities brighter than M_V_=-3.5. In order to increase the accuracy of the age and mass determinations especially for bright clusters, we also include age determinations from the literature. In particular, we use the ages recently derived by Milone et al. (2009A&amp;amp;A...499..755V) for massive intermediate-age star clusters from colour-magnitude fitting and the age data compiled by Mackey &amp;amp; Gilmore (2003MNRAS.338...85M) for 53 massive LMC clusters.</TD>

2002-2007 PLANET microlensing events (Assan+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Most known extrasolar planets (exoplanets) have been discovered using the radial velocity or transit methods. Both are biased towards planets that are relatively close to their parent stars, and studies find that around 17-30% of solar-like stars host a planet. Gravitational microlensing on the other hand, probes planets that are further away from their stars. Recently, a population of planets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered by microlensing. These planets are at least as numerous as the stars in the Milky Way. Here we report a statistical analysis of microlensing data (gathered in 2002-07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5-10AU (Sun-Earth distance) from their stars. We find that of stars host Jupiter-mass planets (0.3-10M_J_, where M_J_=318M_{earth}_ and M_{earth}_ is Earth&quot;s mass). Cool Neptunes (10-30M_{earth}_) and super-Earths (5-10M_{earth}_) are even more common: their respective abundances per star are 52^+22^_-29_% and 62^+35^_-37_%. We conclude that stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception.</TD>

Galaxy clusters in the COSMOS field (Bellagamba+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Galaxy clusters are usually detected in blind optical surveys via suitable filtering methods. We present an optimal matched filter which maximizes their signal-to-noise ratio by taking advantage of the knowledge we have of their intrinsic physical properties and of the data noise properties. In this paper we restrict our application to galaxy magnitudes, positions and photometric redshifts if available, and we also apply the filter separately to weak lensing data. The method is suitable to be naturally extended to a multi-band approach which could include not only additional optical bands but also observables with different nature such as X-rays. For each detection, the filter provides its significance, an estimate for the richness and for the redshift even if photo-z are not given. The provided analytical error estimate is tested against numerical simulations. We finally apply our method to the COSMOS field and compare the results with previous cluster detections obtained with different methods. Our catalogue contains 27 galaxy clusters with minimal threshold at 3{sigma} level including both optical and weak-lensing information.</TD>

Gravitational lenses among z&amp;gt;=4.0 quasars (Richards+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
Images of the 157 quasars were acquired with the High Resolution Camera (HRC) on the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Observations were taken in the SDSS i-band (F775W). The Wide-Field Camera on ACS has higher sensitivity in i than does the HRC but has substantially higher overhead and is mildly undersampled. The exposure times were 640s for each object: 320s in each of two exposures to help in cosmic-ray rejection.</TD>

The Initial Gaia Source List (IGSL) (Smart, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
The IGSL is a compilation catalog produced for the Gaia mission. We have combined data from the following catalogs or datasets to produce a homogenous list of positons, proper motions, photometry in a blue and red band and estimates of the magnitudes in the Gaia G and G_RVS bands. Included Catalogs: Tycho2, LQRF, UCAC4, SDSS-DR9, PPMXL, GSC23, GEPC, OGLE, Sky2000, 2MASS. Note that in compiling the various entries we did not consider the individual flags. Overall, we think this catalog is reliable but there will be errors, mismatches and duplicates. The user should use this catalog with that in mind, it is fine for statistical studies that has some way to remove obviously incorrect entries but it should only be used with care for individual objects. The source catalogs used to produce the IGSL are: * The Gaia Ecliptic Pole Catalog, version 3.0 (GEPC) Altmann &amp;amp; Bastian 2009, &dquot;Ecliptic Poles Catalogue Version 1.1&dquot; ESA Document GAIA-C3-TN-ARI-MA-002 URL http://www.rssd.esa.int/llink/livelink/open/2885828 * GSC2.3: GSC2 version 2.3, Lasker et al. 2008AJ....136..735L (I/305) * an excerpt of the 4th version of the Gaia Initial QSO Catalog (GIQC) as compiled by the GWP-S-335-13000, formed by Alexandre H.

SDSS quasar lens search. II. (Inada+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We report the first results of our systematic search for strongly lensed quasars using the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Among 46420 quasars from the SDSS Data Release 3 (~4188deg^2^), we select a subsample of 22683 quasars that are located at redshifts between 0.6 and 2.2 and are brighter than the Galactic extinction-corrected i-band magnitude of 19.1. We identify 220 lens candidates from the quasar subsample, for which we conduct extensive and systematic follow-up observations in optical and near-infrared wavebands, in order to construct a complete lensed quasar sample at image separations between 1&dquot; and 20&dquot; and flux ratios of faint to bright lensed images larger than 10^-0.5^. We construct a statistical sample of 11 lensed quasars. Ten of these are galaxy-scale lenses with small image separations (~1&dquot;-2&dquot;) and one is a large separation (15&dquot;) system which is produced by a massive cluster of galaxies, representing the first statistical sample of lensed quasars including both galaxy- and cluster-scale lenses. The Data Release 3 spectroscopic quasars contain an additional 11 lensed quasars outside the statistical sample.</TD>

Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum radio sample (Mckean+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We present the selection of the Jodrell Bank Flat-spectrum (JBF) radio source sample, which is designed to reduce the uncertainties in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) gravitational lensing statistics arising from the lack of knowledge about the parent population luminosity function. From observations at 4.86GHz with the Very Large Array, we have selected a sample of 117 flat-spectrum radio sources with flux densities greater than 5mJy. These sources were selected in a similar manner to the CLASS complete sample and are therefore representative of the parent population at low flux densities. The vast majority (~90 per cent) of the JBF sample are found to be compact on the arcsec scales probed here and show little evidence of any extended radio jet emission. Using the JBF and CLASS complete samples, we find the differential number counts slope of the parent population above and below the CLASS 30-mJy flux density limit to be 2.07+/-0.02 and 1.96+/-0.12, respectively.</TD>

SHELS galaxies with 0.02&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.1 (Geller+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
The Deep Lens Survey (DLS, Wittman et al., 2006ApJ...643..128W) is an National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) key program covering 20deg^2^ in five separate fields; we use the 4deg^2^ F2 field at {alpha}=09h19m32.4s and {delta}=+30{deg}00&quot;00&dquot;. The DLS photometry offers the possibility of identifying galaxies with lower surface brightness. Photometric observations of F2 were made with the MOSAIC I imager on the KPNO Mayall 4m telescope between 1999 November and 2004 November. We constructed a galaxy catalog from the R-band source list in F2. We selected galaxy candidates with Kron-Cousins R&amp;lt;=20.6 for spectroscopic observation. SHELS (Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey, Geller et al., 2005ApJ...635L.125G, 2010ApJ...709..832G) is a redshift survey covering the DLS survey F2 field. The SHELS spectra cover the wavelength range 3700-9100{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}. SHELS contains 541 galaxies with R&amp;lt;=20.6 at z&amp;lt;=0.1. We acquired spectra for the objects with the Hectospec on the MMT from 2004 April 13 to 2007 April 20.</TD>

Contact binaries in OGLE-I database (Szymanski+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
The present catalog contains the most numerous, observationally homogeneous sample of contact binaries. It is derived from the OGLE experiment (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment), in the direction of the Galactic Bulge and the Galactic bar. The observations were made with the 1-m Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, over the period 1992 to 1995. The present catalog includes the 1575 newly discovered contact binaries fainter than I=18mag as well as the 1165 brighter contact binaries previously published. It also includes a list of 506 objects with nearly sinusoidal light curves, to ease the comparison and/or distinction between contact binaries with the sinusoidal light curves and pulsating stars.</TD>

Gravitational lensing flexion in A1689 with an AIM (Cain+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Measuring dark matter substructure within galaxy cluster halos is a fundamental probe of the {Lambda}CDM model of structure formation. Gravitational lensing is a technique for measuring the total mass distribution which is independent of the nature of the gravitating matter, making it a vital tool for studying these dark-matter-dominated objects. We present a new method for measuring weak gravitational lensing flexion fields, the gradients of the lensing shear field, to measure mass distributions on small angular scales. While previously published methods for measuring flexion focus on measuring derived properties of the lensed images, such as shapelet coefficients or surface brightness moments, our method instead fits a mass-sheet transformation invariant Analytic Image Model (AIM) to each galaxy image. This simple parametric model traces the distortion of lensed image isophotes and constrains the flexion fields. We test the AIM method using simulated data images with realistic noise and a variety of unlensed image properties, and show that it successfully reproduces the input flexion fields. We also apply the AIM method for flexion measurement to Hubble Space Telescope observations of A1689 and detect mass structure in the cluster using flexion measured with this method. We also estimate the scatter in the measured flexion fields due to the unlensed shape of the background galaxies and find values consistent with previous estimates.</TD>

The Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) is a 60 night NOAO (National Optical Astronomy Observatory) imaging survey program (2005-2008), using the Mosaic-II camera on the Blanco 4m telescope at CTIO (Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory), which has uniformly imaged 75deg^2^ of the sky in the SDSS griz bands. Observations of the lens, which is a rich cluster containing a prominent central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), were made with BCS imaging on 2006 Oct 30 (iz bands), 2006 Dec 14 (gr bands) and 2008 Nov 11 (gr bands) and with Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on 2007 Aug 4 and 14. We obtained GMOS spectra of the source and a number of neighboring galaxies (Lin et al. 2007, Gemini Proposal GS-2007B-Q-228).</TD>

Chromospherically active stars in the Bulge (Drake, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
The MACHO project repeatedly imaged 67 million stars in a total of 182 observation fields toward the Galactic bulge, the LMC, and the SMC to detect the phenomenon of microlensing. These images were taken between 1992 and 2000 on the Mount Stromlo and Siding Springs Observatories&quot; 1.3m Great Melbourne Telescope with the 8x2048^2^pixel dual-color wide-field MACHO camera. In this analysis we concentrate on the Galactic bulge, where 33,000 observations of ~33 million stars were taken in 94 fields. Each observation field covers an area of 43&quot;x43&quot; on the sky. Most observations toward the Galactic bulge have exposure times of 150s.</TD>

Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (Buta+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
The Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) is a comprehensive compilation of diameters, axis ratios, relative bar position angles, and morphologies of inner and outer rings, pseudorings, and lenses in 3692 galaxies south of declination -17{deg}. The purpose of the catalog is to evaluate the idea that these ring phenomena are related to orbital resonances with a bar or oval in galaxy potentials. The catalog is based on visual inspection of most of the 606 fields of the Science Research Council (SRC) IIIa-J southern sky survey, with the ESO-B, ESO-R, and Palomar Sky surveys used as auxiliaries when needed for overexposed core regions. The catalog is most complete for SRC fields 1-303 (mostly south of declination -42{deg}). In addition to ringed galaxies, a list of 859 mostly nonringed galaxies intended for comparison with other catalogs is provided.</TD>

Our selection (see Section 2) lead to a sample of 50836 source quasars. 174 new lensed quasar candidates were observed using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical imaging, near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. Together with the results we reported in Paper II (Inada et al., 2008, Cat. J/AJ/135/496) and Paper IV (Inada et al., 2010, Cat. J/AJ/140/403), we have constructed a statistical sample of 26 lensed quasar (table 5).</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We argue that globular clusters (GCs) are good candidates for gravitational lenses in explaining quasar-galaxy associations. The catalog of associations (Bukhmastova, 2001, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AZh/78/675&amp;gt;) compiled from the LEDA catalog of galaxies (Paturel, 1997A&amp;amp;AS..124..109P) and from the catalog of quasars (Veron-Cetty and Vero, 1998, see Cat. &amp;lt;VII/235&amp;gt;) is used. Based on the new catalog, we show that one might expect an increased number of GCs around irregular galaxies of types 9 and 10 from the hypothesis that distant compact sources are gravitationally lensed by GCs in the halos of foreground galaxies. The King model is used to determine the central surface densities of 135 GCs in the Milky Way. The distribution of GCs in central surface density was found to be lognormal.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs. We analyze the radial distribution of quasars from pairs around galaxies of different types. We show that the quasars from pairs follow the density profile of halo globular clusters. This is new observational evidence that the quasars projected onto the halos of galaxies are magnified by gravitational lensing by halo globular clusters.</TD>

ESA&quot;s Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) was used to perform a deep survey with ISOCAM through three massive gravitationally lensing clusters of galaxies. The total area surveyed depends on source flux, with nearly seventy square arcminutes covered for the brighter flux levels in maps centred on the three clusters Abell 370, Abell 2218 and Abell 2390. We present maps and photometry at 6.7um (hereafter 7um) and 14.3um (hereafter 15um), showing a total of 145 mid-infrared sources and the associated source counts.</TD>

Optical properties of WISE galaxies (Hwang+, 2012)</TD>

The Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey (SHELS) is a magnitude-limited redshift survey covering the 4deg^2^ region of the DLS (Deep Lens Survey) F2 field (Geller et al. 2005ApJ...635L.125G, 2010ApJ...709..832G, 2012, Cat. J/AJ/143/102). The F2 field is one of the five fields and is centered on RA=09h19m32.4s and DE=+30:00:00. The DLS R-band images were taken in seeing 0.9&dquot;; the source detection on these images reaches down to 28.7mag/arcsec^2^. The spectroscopic observations for SHELS galaxies were conducted for galaxies down to Rmag=20.6 with the Hectospec 300 fiber spectrograph on the MMT (see Geller et al. 2012, Cat. J/AJ/143/102, for detailed description of the spectroscopic observations). The spectra cover the wavelength range 3650-9150{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}. We use the WISE all-sky survey catalog, which contains uniform photometric data for over 563 million objects at four MIR bands (3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22um). WISE covers the entire region of the SHELS field to a homogeneous depth.</TD>

We carried out H-band observations of UM673 with the Subaru Infra-Red Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) using an adaptive optics system with 188 control elements (AO188). The images were reduced following the procedure described in &dquot;Subaru Data Reduction CookBook: Imaging Observation with IRCS&dquot; by Y. Minowa (see also Minowa et al. 2005ApJ...629...29M). The final Subaru H-band stack image of UM673 was created by coadding 22 reduced single exposure images. We also created the exposure time map of the stack image. The 17x10arcsec subframe of the stack image and the corresponding exposure map displayed in Figures 1 and 2 of the paper are available as fits files.</TD>

South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zeldovich Survey Point Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This table contains a a point-source catalog from 771 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel&quot;dovich (SPT-SZ) survey at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. 1,545 sources are detected above 4.5-sigma significance in at least one band. Based on their relative brightness between survey bands, the authors classify the sources into two populations, one dominated by synchrotron emission from active galactic nuclei, and one dominated by thermal emission from dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. They find 1,238 synchrotron and 307 dusty sources. The authors cross-match all sources against external catalogs and find 189 unidentified synchrotron sources and 189 unidentified dusty sources. The dusty sources without counterparts are good candidates for high-redshift, strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies. The authors derive number counts for each population from 1 Jy down to roughly 11, 4, and 11 mJy at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. They compare these counts with galaxy population models and find that none of the models they consider for either population provide a good fit to the measured counts in all three bands. The disparities imply that these measurements will be an important input to the next generation of millimeter-wave extragalactic source population models. The SPT is a 10-m telescope located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station in Antarctica. At 150 GHz (2 mm), the SPT has arcminute angular resolution and a 1 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; diffraction-limited field of view. The SPT was designed for high-sensitivity millimeter/sub-millimeter observations of faint, low-contrast sources, such as CMB anisotropies. The first survey with the SPT, designated as the SPT-SZ survey, was completed in 2011 November and covers a ~2500 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; region of the southern extragalactic sky in three frequency bands, 95, 150, and 220 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 3.2, 2.0, and 1.4 mm. The fields were surveyed to depths of approximately 40, 18, and 70 microK arcmin at 95, 150, and 220NASA/GSFC HEASARC</TD>

Massive galaxy clusters lensing analyse (Richard+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
High-resolution imaging data taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) or Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) instrument on HST are available for each selected cluster in one or two bands, either through our dedicated LoCuSS programme (GO-DD 11312, PI: G.P. Smith) or from the archive. J- and KS-band data were obtained between 2003 March and 2007 April on the following near-infrared instruments: Wide Infrared Camera (WIRC) on the Palomar-200-inch telescope, Infrared Side Port Imager (ISPI) on the CTIO Blanco 4-m telescope and Florida Infrared Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (FLAMINGOS) on the Kitt Peak (KPNO) 4-m telescope. We used the LRIS on the Keck-I telescope to perform long-slit and multislit observations of the clusters. The spectroscopic data used in the current paper are the outcome of six different observing runs between 2004 and 2008.</TD>

Massive clusters in the LMC (Baumgardt+, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
We use four recent compilations of LMC star cluster parameters to derive a combined catalogue for LMC clusters. Our first catalogue is the recent work of Glatt et al. (2010, Cat. J/A+A/517/A50), who used data from the MCPS together with isochrone fitting to derive ages and luminosities for 1193 populous star clusters in a 64deg^2^ area of the LMC. The second data set that we use is the catalogue of Pietrzynski &amp;amp; Udalski (2200, Cat. J/AcA/50/337), who used BVI data from the OGLE II microlensing experiment (Udalski et al., 1998, Cat, J/AcA/48/147) together with isochrone fitting to derive ages of about 600 star clusters which are located in the central parts of the LMC and are younger than 1.2Gyr. Our third catalogue is the cluster catalogue presented by Hunter et al. (2003AJ....126.1836H). The Hunter et al. catalogue contains data for about 746 different LMC clusters, limited to the inner regions of the LMC and to absolute luminosities brighter than M_V_=-3.5. In order to increase the accuracy of the age and mass determinations especially for bright clusters, we also include age determinations from the literature. In particular, we use the ages recently derived by Milone et al. (2009A&amp;amp;A...499..755V) for massive intermediate-age star clusters from colour-magnitude fitting and the age data compiled by Mackey &amp;amp; Gilmore (2003MNRAS.338...85M) for 53 massive LMC clusters.</TD>

SDSS quasar lens search (Oguri+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
We present an algorithm for selecting a uniform sample of gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.2) quasars brighter than i=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our algorithm uses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small- and large-separation lenses, respectively. Our selection algorithm only relies on parameters that the SDSS standard image processing pipeline generates, allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. The algorithm has been tested against simulated SDSS images, which adopt distributions of field and quasar parameters taken from the real SDSS data as input. Furthermore, we take differential reddening into account. We find that our selection algorithm is almost complete down to separations of 1&dquot; and flux ratios of 10^-0.5^.</TD>

<TD>
Australia Telescope 20-GHz (AT20G) High-Angular Resolution Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the high-angular-resolution catalog for the Australia Telescope 20-GHz (AT20G) survey, using the high-angular-resolution 6-km antenna data at the baselines of ~4500 m of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The authors have used the data to produce the visibility catalog that separates the compact active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the extended radio sources at the 0.15-arcsecond angular scale, corresponding to the linear size scale of 1 kpc at redshifts higher than 0.7. They find the radio population at 20 GHz to be dominated by compact AGNs constituting 77% of the total sources in the AT20G. In the paper, they introduce the visibility-spectra diagnostic plot, produced using the AT20G cross-matches with lower frequency radio surveys at 1 GHz [the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS: Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693) and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS: Mauch et al. 2003, MNRAS, 342, 1117)], that separates the 20-GHz population into distinct sub-populations of the compact AGNs, the compact steep-spectrum (CSS) sources, the extended AGN-powered sources and extended flat-spectrum sources. The extended flat-spectrum sources include a local thermal emitting population of high-latitude planetary nebulae and also gravitational lens and binary black hole candidates among the AGNs. The authors find a smooth transition in properties between the CSS sources and the AGN populations. The visibility catalog, together with the main AT20G survey, provides an estimate of angular size scales for sources in the AT20G and an estimate of the flux arising from central cores of extended radio sources. The identification of the compact AGNs in the AT20G survey provides high-quality calibrators for high-frequency radio telescope arrays and very large baseline interferometry observations.</TD>

1998-2000 OGLE events microlensing limits (Tsapras+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
The data sets presented here were obtained from the DoPhot analysis of the events available at the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) website, ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/olge . For the purposes of this analysis, we only considered the events for which the point-source point-lens (PSPL) model provided adequate fits. Out of a total of 162 events observed by the OGLE (Udalski, 1994ApJ...436L.103U) collaboration during a three-year period (1998-2000), we found that for 145 of these the reduced {chi}^2^ of the PSPL model fit, adjusting six parameters, approached a value of unity, indicating a good fit.</TD>

Flat-spectrum symmetric radio sources (Augusto+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
The radio sources listed below were selected from the Jodrell-VLA Astrometric Survey and the Cosmic-Lens All-Sky Survey (part 1) and constitute a (non-complete) parent sample for the selection of flat-spectrum symmetric object candidates (the ones which show structure, when their VLA-A 8.4GHz data are analysed). The parent sample contains northern hemisphere objects with 8.4GHz flux densities greater than 100mJy, galactic latitudes greater than 10 degrees and 1.40-to-4.85GHz spectral indices (when known; if not, the source is kept in the sample) smaller than 0.50 (flat). The most relevant properties of the parent sample are listed in the Table.</TD>

Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS) Point Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This study presents the first set of maps and band-merged catalog from the Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS). Observations at 250, 350, and 500 micron (um) were taken with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instrument onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. HerS covers 79 square degrees along the SDSS Stripe 82 to an average depth of 13.0, 12.9, and 14.8 mJy beam&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (including confusion) at 250, 350, and 500 um, respectively. HerS was designed to measure correlations with external tracers of the dark matter density field, either point-like (i.e., galaxies selected from radio to X-ray) or extended (i.e., clusters and gravitational lensing), in order to measure the bias and redshift distribution of intensities of infrared-emitting dusty star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. By locating HerS in Stripe 82, the authors maximize the overlap with available and upcoming cosmological surveys. The band-merged catalog contains 3.3 x 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; sources detected at a significance of &amp;amp;gt;~ 3 sigma (including confusion noise). The maps and catalog are available at &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/&dquot;&amp;gt;http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This table contains the first HerS band-merged point source catalog based on observations covering 79 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; in the equatorial Stripe 82, spanning 13 to 37 degrees (0&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 54&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to 2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 24&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; ) in RA, and -2 to +2 degrees in Declination. The SPIRE beams are 18.1, 25.2 and 36.6 arcseconds at 250, 350 and 500 um, respectively. The band-merged catalog was constructed, after filtering, with DESPHOT (Roseboom et al. 2010, MNRAS, 409, 48), using 250-um sources (extracted with STARFINDER: Diolaiti et al. 2000, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 147, 335) as positional priors.

OGLE high proper motion stars towards MC (Soszynski+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of high proper motion (HPM) stars detected in the foreground of central parts of the Magellanic Clouds. The Catalog contains 2161 objects in the 4.5 square degree area towards the LMC, and 892 HPM stars in the 2.4 square degree area towards the SMC. The Catalog is based on observations collected during four years of the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the images provided candidate HPM stars with proper motion as small as 4mas/yr. These appeared as pseudo-variables, and were all measured astrometrically on all CCD images, providing typically about 400 data points per star. The reference frame was defined by the majority of background stars, most of them members of the Magellanic Clouds. The reflex motion due to solar velocity with respect to the local standards of rest is clearly seen. The largest proper motion in our sample is 363mas/yr. Parallaxes were measured with errors smaller than 20% for several stars.</TD>

Exoplanet masses derived from RVs (Brown+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Exoplanet searches using radial velocity (RV) and microlensing (ML) produce samples of &dquot;projected&dquot; mass and orbital radius, respectively. We present a new method for estimating the probability density distribution (density) of the unprojected quantity from such samples. For a sample of n data values, the method involves solving n simultaneous linear equations to determine the weights of delta functions for the raw, unsmoothed density of the unprojected quantity that cause the associated cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the projected quantity to exactly reproduce the empirical CDF of the sample at the locations of the n data values. We smooth the raw density using nonparametric kernel density estimation with a normal kernel of bandwidth {sigma}. We calibrate the dependence of {sigma} on n by Monte Carlo experiments performed on samples drawn from a theoretical density, in which the integrated square error is minimized. We scale this calibration to the ranges of real RV samples using the Normal Reference Rule. The resolution and amplitude accuracy of the estimated density improve with n. For typical RV and ML samples, we expect the fractional noise at the PDF peak to be approximately 80n^-log2^. For illustrations, we apply the new method to 67 RV values given a similar treatment by Jorissen et al. (2001A&amp;amp;A...379..992J), and to the 308 RV values listed at exoplanets.org on 2010 October 20.</TD>

<TD>
We present the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey-ARCS (SARCS) sample from the completed CFHTLS-WIDE and CFHTLS-DEEP covering a combined unmasked area of ~150deg^2^ in the sky. The lens sample is compiled through a semi-automatic technique consisting of using the ARCFINDER algorithm, followed by visual inspection and ranking of the candidates. We briefly described how ARCFINDER works (Alard 2006astro.ph..6757A) and the modifications implemented in the newer version of the algorithm.</TD>

This database table contains the 13th edition of the Catalog of Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei by Veron-Cetty and Veron, and is an update of the previous versions. As in the previous editions, no information about absorption lines or X-ray properties is given, but absolute magnitides are provided, assuming a Hubble constant H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 71 km/s/Mpc and a deceleration parameter q&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0 (notice the change of cosmology from previous editions in which H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; was assumed to be 50 km/s/Mpc). The present edition of this catalog contains 133336 quasars, 1374 BL Lac objects and 34231 active galaxies (including 15627 Seyfert 1 galaxies), for a grand total of 168941 objects, significantly more than the number of objects listed in the 12th edition (108080). The 13th edition includes positions and redshifts, as well as photometry (U, B, and V) and 6-cm and 20-cm flux densities, when available. 178 objects once proposed but now rejected as quasars are NOT included in the online version of this catalog: their names and positions are listed in the file &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/258/reject.dat&dquot;&amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/258/reject.dat&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This HEASARC table also does NOT contain the additional information on gravitationally lensed quasars and quasar pairs listed in Tables 3 and 4 of the published paper: these tables are available in electronic form at the CDS &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/248/&dquot;&amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/248/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; files table2.dat and table3.dat (sic).

OGLE UBVI phot. in Baade&quot;s Window (Paczynski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present UBVI photometry for 8530 stars in Baade&quot;s Window obtained during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. Among these are over one thousand red clump giants. 1391 of them have photometry with errors smaller than 0.04, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.20 mag in the I, V, B, and U-band, respectively. We constructed a map of interstellar reddening. The corrected colors of the red clump giants: (U-B)_0_, (B-V)_0_, and (V-I)_0_ are very well correlated, indicating that a single parameter determines the observed spread of their values, reaching almost 2mag in the (U-B)_0_. It seems most likely that heavy element content is the dominant parameter, but it is possible that another parameter: the age (or mass) of a star moves it along the same trajectory in the color-color diagram as the metallicity. The current ambiguity can be resolved with spectral analysis, and our catalog may be useful as a finding list of red clump giants. We point out that these K giants are more suitable for a fair determination of the distribution of metallicity than brighter M giants. We also present a compilation of UBVI data for 308 red clump giants near the Sun, for which Hipparcos parallaxes are more accurate than 10%. Spectral analysis of their metallicity may provide information about the local metallicity distribution as well as the extent to which mass (age) of these stars affects their colors.</TD>

LMC Cepheids in OGLE and MACHO data (Poleski+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
Pulsation period of Cepheids should change as stars evolve through the instability strip. Rates of these changes found by other authors based on the decades-long OâC diagrams show rather good agreement with theoretical predictions. We have checked the variability on the scale of a few years on the data recently published by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) for the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids and found period changes for 18% of fundamental mode and 41% of first overtone pulsators. It suggest the overtone pulsations are less stable than the fundamental ones. For stars which had the cross-references in the MACHO catalog we have checked if the period change rates derived from the OGLE and the MACHO data are consistent.</TD>

This paper presents a new complete and well-defined sample of flat-spectrum radio sources (FSRS) selected from the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS), with the further constraint of a bright (mag&amp;lt;=17.5) optical counterpart. The sample has been designed to produce a large number of low-luminosity blazars in order to test the current unifying models in the low-luminosity regime. In this first paper the new sample is presented and the radio properties of the 325 sources contained therein are discussed.</TD>

OGLE-II High proper motion stars (Eyer+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
The difference image analysis (DIA) of the images obtained by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-II) revealed a peculiar artefact in the sample of stars proposed as variable by Woniak in one of the Galactic bulge fields: the occurrence of pairs of candidate variables showing anti-correlated light curves monotonic over a period of 3 yr. This effect can be understood, quantified and related to the stellar proper motions. DIA photometry supplemented with a simple model offers an effective and easy way to detect high proper motion stars in very dense stellar fields, where conventional astrometric searches are extremely inefficient.</TD>

Gravitational lensing of SN 1997ff (Mortsell+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
We investigate the effects of gravitational lensing due to intervening galaxies on the recently discovered Type Ia supernova at z~1.7, SN 1997ff, in the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that it is possible to obtain a wide range of magnifications by varying the mass and/or the velocity dispersion normalization of the lensing galaxies. In order to be able to use SN 1997ff to constrain the redshift-distance relation, very detailed modeling of the galaxies to control the systematic effects from lensing is necessary. Thus, we argue that, based on our current limited knowledge of the lensing galaxies, it is difficult to use SN 1997ff to constrain the values of {Omega}_M_ and {Omega}_{Lambda}, or even to place severe limits on gray dust obscuration or luminosity evolution of Type Ia supernovae.</TD>

VLBA imaging and polarimetry survey at 5GHz (Helmboldt+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We have chosen the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS; Myers et al. 2003, Cat. &amp;lt;VIII/72&amp;gt;) as our parent sample. We have also restricted our sample to lie on the survey area, of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Among our target list, 141 have already been observed at 5 GHz with the VLBA as part of the Caltech-Jordell Bank Flat-Spectrum survey (CJF; Taylor et al., 1996ApJS..107...37T; Pollack et al., 2003, Cat. &amp;lt;J/ApJ/589/733&amp;gt;), eight have been or will be observed at 15GHz as part of the Monitoring of Jets in AGNs with VLBA Experiments (MOJAVE) project (Lister &amp;amp; Homan, 2005, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AJ/130/1389&amp;gt;), and 20 were observed for the VIPS pilot program at 5 and 15GHz (Taylor et al., 2005ApJS..159...27T). Each of these surveys contains VLBA observations at 5 or 15GHz that have adequate sensitivity for our purposes. The remaining 958 sources were observed with the VLBA within 18 separate observing runs of approximately 11hr each from 2006 January to August.</TD>

We fit the lens spectral energy distributions (SEDs) consisting of ugriz magnitudes with a three-parameter grid (age, star-formation timescale, and photometric mass) of Bruzual &amp;amp; Charlot&quot;s (2003MNRAS.344.1000B) and Maraston&quot;s (2005MNRAS.362..799M) composite stellar-population models, computed by adopting solar metallicity and various initial mass functions (IMFs). We also utilize the best-fit parameters derived from the lens models of the total projected mass enclosed within the disk defined by the Einstein radius of each system.</TD>

OGLE Galactic Bulge periodic variables (Udalski+ 1996)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars in the Galactic Bulge. The Catalog is based on observations collected during the OGLE (Optical Graviational Lensing Experiment) microlensing search: (1) 213 periodic variable stars brighter than Imag=18mag: 31 pulsating, 116 eclipsing and 66 miscellaneous type variables from the Baade&quot;s Window BWC field are presented. (2) 800 variable stars found in four Baade&quot;s Window fields BW1, BW2, BW3 and BW4 are presented. Among them 71 are classified as pulsating, 465 as eclipsing and 264 as miscellaneous type. (3) 644 variable stars: 64 pulsating, 352 eclipsing and 228 miscellaneous type were detected in four Baade&quot;s Window fields BW5, BW6, BW7 and BW8. Analysis of periodic variable stars found in overlapping regions of the Baade&quot;s Window fields yields an average completeness of the Catalog equal to about 80% of periodic variables objects registered in the OGLE databases and about 65% of all periodic variable stars in the observed region of the sky. (4) 631 variable stars: 59 pulsating, 348 eclipsing and 224 miscellaneous type were detected in third Baade&quot;s Window fields BW9, BW10, and BW11. (5) 574 variables stars: 44 pulsating, 369 eclipsing and 161 miscellaneous type were detected in four fields located symmetrically in the galactic latitude around the Galactic center: MM5-A, MM5-B, MM7-A and MM7-B.</TD>

NOT GL survey of multiply imaged quasars (Jaunsen+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
A gravitational lens (GL)-search program, initiated in 1990 at the Nordic Optcal Telescope (NOT), has revealed several possible GL-candidates among a sample of 168 quasars (QSOs), chosen from three lists compiled by C. Hazard, D. Reimers and J. Surdej, respectively. Some of these candidates, selected for having close companions (within 5 arcseconds), were imaged in several filters and their colours compared. Low dispersion spectra of the most promising candidates were also obtained at the NOT and ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT). None of these has proved to be strong candidates of gravitational lensing effects. We present this new sample of QSOs and combine it with previously published optical QSO samples in a statistical analysis to yield constraints on flat cosmologies and galaxy velocity dispersions.</TD>

Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (13th Ed.) (Veron+ 2010)</TD>
<TD>
This catalogue is a compilation of all known AGNs presented in a compact and convenient form. It is an update of the previous versions; and as in the previous editions no information about absorption lines of X-ray properties are given, but absolute magnitudes are given, assuming Ho=71km/s/Mpc and q_0_=0 (notice the change of cosmology: Ho was assumed to be 50km/s/Mpc in the previous editions). When available, the 20cm and 6cm radio flux are given. The present edition of this catalogue contains the quasars with measured redshift known prior to July 1st, 2009. It contains 133336 quasars, 1374 BL Lac objects and 34231 active galaxies (including 15627 Seyfert 1&quot;s), almost doubling the number listed in the 12th edition. Lists of known lensed quasars (table2.dat) and double quasars (table3.dat) are also given here.</TD>

The photometric data were collected during the second phase of the OGLE microlensing search from 1997 to 2000. The eclipsing objects were selected with the automatic search algorithm based on an artificial neural network. Basic statistics of eclipsing stars are presented. Also, the list of 36 candidates of detached eclipsing binaries for spectroscopic study and for precise LMC distance determination is provided. The full catalog is accessible from the OGLE Internet archive.</TD>

BVI photometry of OGLE LMC Cepheids (Udalski+, 1999)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of Cepheids from the LMC. The Catalog contains 1333 objects detected in the 4.5 square degree area of central parts of the LMC. About 3.4*10^5^ BVI measurements of these stars were collected during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Catalog data include period, BVI photometry, astrometry, and R_21_, phi_21_ parameters of the Fourier decomposition of I-band light curve. The vast majority of objects from the Catalog are the classical Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode. The remaining objects include Population II Cepheids and red giants with pulsation-like light curves. Tests of completeness performed in overlapping parts of adjacent fields indicate that completeness of the Catalog is very high: &amp;gt;96%. Statistics and distributions of basic parameters of Cepheids are also presented. Finally, we show the light curves of three eclipsing systems containing Cepheid detected among objects of the Catalog. All presented data, including individual BVI observations are available from the OGLE Internet archive at URL: ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/var_stars/lmc/cep/catalog/</TD>

Massive galaxy clusters lensing analyse (Richard+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
High-resolution imaging data taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) or Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) instrument on HST are available for each selected cluster in one or two bands, either through our dedicated LoCuSS programme (GO-DD 11312, PI: G.P. Smith) or from the archive. J- and KS-band data were obtained between 2003 March and 2007 April on the following near-infrared instruments: Wide Infrared Camera (WIRC) on the Palomar-200-inch telescope, Infrared Side Port Imager (ISPI) on the CTIO Blanco 4-m telescope and Florida Infrared Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (FLAMINGOS) on the Kitt Peak (KPNO) 4-m telescope. We used the LRIS on the Keck-I telescope to perform long-slit and multislit observations of the clusters. The spectroscopic data used in the current paper are the outcome of six different observing runs between 2004 and 2008.</TD>

OGLE: Gaia South Ecliptic Pole Field (Soszynski+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Gaia South Ecliptic Pole (GSEP) field, 5.3 square degrees area around the South Ecliptic Pole on the outskirts of the LMC, based on the data collected during the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, OGLE-IV. The GSEP field will be observed during the commissioning phase of the ESA Gaia space mission for testing and calibrating the Gaia instruments. We provide the photometric maps of the GSEP region containing the mean VI photometry of all detected stellar objects and their equatorial coordinates. We show the quality and completeness of the OGLE-IV photometry and color-magnitude diagrams of this region. We conducted an extensive search for variable stars in the GSEP field leading to the discovery of 6789 variable stars. In this sample we found 132 classical Cepheids, 686 RR Lyr type stars, 2819 long-period, and 1377 eclipsing variables. Several objects deserving special attention were also selected, including a new classical Cepheid in a binary eclipsing system.</TD>

Multiply imaged gravitational lens systems (Limousin+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution of galaxy cluster Abell 1689 at z=0.18 using detected strong lensing features from deep ACS observations and extensive ground based spectroscopy. Earlier analyses have reported up to 32 multiply imaged systems in this cluster, of which only 3 were spectroscopically confirmed. In this work, we present a parametric strong lensing mass reconstruction using 34 multiply imaged systems of which 24 have newly determined spectroscopic redshifts, which is a major step forward in building a robust mass model. In turn, the new spectroscopic data allows a more secure identification of multiply imaged systems.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We argue that globular clusters (GCs) are good candidates for gravitational lenses in explaining quasar-galaxy associations. The catalog of associations (Bukhmastova, 2001, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AZh/78/675&amp;gt;) compiled from the LEDA catalog of galaxies (Paturel, 1997A&amp;amp;AS..124..109P) and from the catalog of quasars (Veron-Cetty and Vero, 1998, see Cat. &amp;lt;VII/235&amp;gt;) is used. Based on the new catalog, we show that one might expect an increased number of GCs around irregular galaxies of types 9 and 10 from the hypothesis that distant compact sources are gravitationally lensed by GCs in the halos of foreground galaxies. The King model is used to determine the central surface densities of 135 GCs in the Milky Way. The distribution of GCs in central surface density was found to be lognormal.</TD>

Log of Subaru Prime Focus Camera Exposures (ADAC NAOJ, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
This database contains a log of the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) exposures since April 2001. The data are regularly updated, and the last date of the log is written in &dquot;File Summary&dquot;. Note that from this version of Nov. 2005, the data number is largely increased because those data with worse position determination (up to 30 arcsec error) are included. Suprime-Cam is an 80-mega pixels (10240 x 8192) mosaic CCD camera, for the wide-field prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34&quot;x27&quot;, a unique facility among the 8-10m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0&dquot;.202 per pixel. The focal plane consists of ten high- resistivity 2kx2k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which are cooled by a large Stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. A filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type is designed that can hold up to ten large filters (205x170x15mm^3^). The wide-field corrector is basically a three-lens Wynne- type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector. The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of 30&quot; in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller than 30um peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image over the entire field. The median seeing in the I_c-band, measured over one year and a half, is 0&dquot;.61. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the time of commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging. For details, see: Miyazaki et al., Publ. Astron. Soc. Japan 54, 833-853, 2002 (2002PASJ...54..833M)</TD>

BVR photometry of MS0302+17 (Gavazzi+, 2004)</TD>
<TD>
We report the sample of galaxies we used for the MS0302+17 photometric and weak lensing analysis, observed on October 12, 1999 with the CFH12K camera mounted at the prime focus of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. In the same file, we report background lensed galaxies, supercluster and foreground early-types galaxies. Stars are also presented. When unknown, fields are assigned an arbitrary value of -99.00. The AB photometry is for CFH12k filters. The R image is much deeper. So we detected more objects with sometimes no B or V reliable counter-part. Coordinates are in J2000. We introduce a flag in order to identify the type. Lenses (either supercluster members (flag=2) or foreground(flag=3)) do not contribute to the lensing signal and we do not report ellipticity components whereas for background galaxies (flag=1), we report (e1,e2) components with the corresponding uncertainty. They are corrected from PSF smearing using standard KSB method. We also report stars (flag=4) that have been used for PSF smearing correction. In this case, we report (e1,e2) ellipticity components before and after psf-correction. Unused objects (that may contain spurious detections!!) are reported with flag=0. Use them with caution.</TD>

Detailed morphology of SDSS galaxies (Nair+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of detailed visual classifications for 14034 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4, Cat. &amp;lt;II/267&amp;gt;). Our sample includes nearly all spectroscopically targeted galaxies in the redshift range 0.01&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.1 down to an apparent extinction-corrected limit of g&amp;lt;16mag. In addition to T-Types, we record the existence of bars, rings, lenses, tails, warps, dust lanes, arm flocculence, and multiplicity. This sample defines a comprehensive local galaxy sample which we will use in future papers to study low-redshift morphology. It will also prove useful for calibrating automated galaxy classification algorithms. In this paper, we describe the classification methodology used, detail the systematics and biases of our sample, and summarize the overall statistical properties of the sample, noting the most obvious trends that are relevant for general comparisons of our catalog with previously published work.</TD>

BAX is designed to support astronomical research by providing access to published measurements of the main physical quantities and to the related bibliographic references: basic data stored in the database are cluster/group identifiers, equatorial coordinates, redshift, flux, X-ray luminosity (in the ROSAT band) and temperature, and (in the online version at &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&dquot;&amp;gt;http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) links to additional linked parameters (in X-rays, such as spatial profile parameters, as well as SZ parameters of the hot gas, lensing measurements, and data at other wavelengths, such as the optical and radio bands). The clusters and groups in the online BAX database can be queried by the basic parameters as well as the linked parameters or combinations of these. The authors expect BAX to become an important tool for the astronomical community. BAX will optimize various aspects of the scientific analysis of X-ray clusters and groups of galaxies, from proposal planning to data collection, interpretation and publication, from both ground based facilities like MEGACAM (CFHT), VIRMOS (VLT) and from space missions like XMM-Newton, Chandra and Planck.</TD>

QSO luminosity function at z~4 (Glikman+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
We make use of publicly available deep imaging data from the NDWFS (NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey) in the Bootes field from the DR3 (B_W_,R,I bands) and from the DLS (Deep Lens Survey; DR3 in B,V,R and z&quot; bands). DLS is closely related to the NDWFS in that the optical imaging has been obtained on the same 4m Mayall Telescope (at KPNO) and Blanco Telescope (at CTIO) using the same wide-field optical imagers Mosaic-I and Mosaic-II as the NDWFS. We obtained 28 spectra for the DLS and NDWFS candidates and found 23 high-redshift quasars (the remaining objects were three Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3.9, one Type-II active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z~0.2 and one featureless, unidentified spectrum). All but two of our spectra were taken with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea. Five quasars were discovered on UT 2005 November 28 and 29. Only the red camera was used, with the 400lines/mm grating blazed at 8500{AA}. Sixteen additional quasars were discovered during a run on UT 2006 May 20-22. Two additional spectra were taken on UT 2006 March 25 and 26 with the Multi-Aperture Red Spectrometer (MARS) on the Mayall 4m telescope at Kitt Peak.</TD>

Gravitational lenses among z&amp;gt;=4.0 quasars (Richards+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
Images of the 157 quasars were acquired with the High Resolution Camera (HRC) on the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Observations were taken in the SDSS i-band (F775W). The Wide-Field Camera on ACS has higher sensitivity in i than does the HRC but has substantially higher overhead and is mildly undersampled. The exposure times were 640s for each object: 320s in each of two exposures to help in cosmic-ray rejection.</TD>

The CLASS blazar survey. I. (Marcha+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
This paper presents a new complete and well-defined sample of flat-spectrum radio sources (FSRS) selected from the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS), with the further constraint of a bright (mag&amp;lt;=17.5) optical counterpart. The sample has been designed to produce a large number of low-luminosity blazars in order to test the current unifying models in the low-luminosity regime. In this first paper the new sample is presented and the radio properties of the 325 sources contained therein are discussed.</TD>

Gravitational lensing of SN 1997ff (Mortsell+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
We investigate the effects of gravitational lensing due to intervening galaxies on the recently discovered Type Ia supernova at z~1.7, SN 1997ff, in the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that it is possible to obtain a wide range of magnifications by varying the mass and/or the velocity dispersion normalization of the lensing galaxies. In order to be able to use SN 1997ff to constrain the redshift-distance relation, very detailed modeling of the galaxies to control the systematic effects from lensing is necessary. Thus, we argue that, based on our current limited knowledge of the lensing galaxies, it is difficult to use SN 1997ff to constrain the values of {Omega}_M_ and {Omega}_{Lambda}, or even to place severe limits on gray dust obscuration or luminosity evolution of Type Ia supernovae.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs. We analyze the radial distribution of quasars from pairs around galaxies of different types. We show that the quasars from pairs follow the density profile of halo globular clusters. This is new observational evidence that the quasars projected onto the halos of galaxies are magnified by gravitational lensing by halo globular clusters.</TD>

Exoplanet masses derived from RVs (Brown+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Exoplanet searches using radial velocity (RV) and microlensing (ML) produce samples of &dquot;projected&dquot; mass and orbital radius, respectively. We present a new method for estimating the probability density distribution (density) of the unprojected quantity from such samples. For a sample of n data values, the method involves solving n simultaneous linear equations to determine the weights of delta functions for the raw, unsmoothed density of the unprojected quantity that cause the associated cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the projected quantity to exactly reproduce the empirical CDF of the sample at the locations of the n data values. We smooth the raw density using nonparametric kernel density estimation with a normal kernel of bandwidth {sigma}. We calibrate the dependence of {sigma} on n by Monte Carlo experiments performed on samples drawn from a theoretical density, in which the integrated square error is minimized. We scale this calibration to the ranges of real RV samples using the Normal Reference Rule. The resolution and amplitude accuracy of the estimated density improve with n. For typical RV and ML samples, we expect the fractional noise at the PDF peak to be approximately 80n^-log2^. For illustrations, we apply the new method to 67 RV values given a similar treatment by Jorissen et al. (2001A&amp;amp;A...379..992J), and to the 308 RV values listed at exoplanets.org on 2010 October 20.</TD>

Radio identification of EGRET sources (Mattox+ 1997)</TD>
<TD>
We present a method to assess the reliability of the identification of EGRET sources with extragalactic radio sources. We verify that EGRET is detecting the blazar class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However many published identifications are found to be questionable. We provide a table of 42 blazars that we expect to be robust identifications of EGRET sources. This includes one previously unidentified EGRET source, the lensed AGN PKS 1830-210, near the direction of the Galactic center. We provide the best available positions for 16 more radio sources that are also potential identifications for previously unidentified EGRET sources. All high Galactic latitude EGRET sources (|b|&amp;gt;3) that demonstrate significant variability can be identified with flat-spectrum radio sources. This suggests that EGRET is not detecting any type of AGN other than blazars. This identification method has been used to establish with 99.998% confidence that the peak gamma-ray flux of a blazar is correlated with its average 5GHz radio flux. An even better correlation is seen between gamma-ray flux and the 2.29GHz flux density measured with VLBI at the base of the radio jet. Also, using high-confidence identifications, we find that the radio sources identified with EGRET sources have greater correlated VLBI flux densities than the parent population of flat radio spectrum sources.</TD>

OGLE microlensing events in Galactic Bulge (Udalski+, 2000)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of microlensing events detected toward the Galactic bulge in three observing seasons, 1997-1999, during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The search for microlensing events was performed using a database of about 4x10^9^ photometric measurements of about 20.5 million stars from the Galactic bulge. The Catalog comprises 214 microlensing events found in the fields covering about 11 square degrees on the sky and distributed in different parts of the Galactic bulge. The sample includes 20 binary microlensing events, 14 of them are caustic crossing. In one case a double star is likely lensed. We present distribution of the basic parameters of microlensing events and show preliminary rate of microlensing in different regions of the Galactic bulge. The latter reveals clear dependence on the Galactic coordinates. The dependence on l indicates that the majority of lenses toward the Galactic bulge are located in the Galactic bar. Models of the Galactic bar seem to reasonably predict the observed spatial distribution of microlensing events in the Galactic bulge. All data presented in the Catalog and photometry of all events are available from the OGLE Internet archive.</TD>

MACHO Galactic Bulge microlensing events (Thomas+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present a catalog of 450 relatively high signal-to-noise ratio microlensing events observed by the MACHO collaboration between 1993 and 1999. The events are distributed throughout our fields, and as expected, they show a clear concentration toward the Galactic center. No optical depth is given for this sample, since no blending efficiency calculation has been performed and we find evidence for substantial blending. In a companion paper we give optical depths for the subsample of events on clump giant source stars, where blending is a less significant effect. Several events with sources that may belong to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy are identified. For these events even relatively low dispersion spectra could suffice to classify these events as either consistent with Sagittarius membership or as non-Sagittarius sources. Several unusual events, such as microlensing of periodic variable source stars, binary lens events, and an event showing extended source effects, are identified. We also identify a number of contaminating background events as cataclysmic variable stars.</TD>

Redshift survey in the Subaru GTO2deg^2^ field (Kurtz+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Miyazaki et al. (2002ApJ...580L..97M, 2007, Cat. J/ApJ/669/714) used the 8.2m Subaru Telescope to carry out a weak-lensing survey of 13 well-separated fields covering a total of 21.82deg^2^. They used lensing convergence maps to identify 100 candidate halos with S/N {nu}&amp;gt;3.7; 10 of these candidates are within the GTO2deg^2^ field we examined here. We constructed the galaxy catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008, Cat. II/294) r-band galaxy list for the GTO2deg^2^ field. We acquired spectra for the objects with the Hectospec, a 300-fiber robotic instrument mounted on the MMT from 2009 February 1 to 2009 April 27. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3500-10000{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}.</TD>

Shape of CL 1358+62 galaxies (Moller+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
Observations of early-type galaxies, both in the local Universe and in clusters at medium redshifts, suggest that these galaxies often contain discs or disc-like structures. Using the results of Kelson et al. (2000ApJ...531..137K) for the incidence of disc-components among the galaxies in the redshift z=0.33 cluster CL 1358+62, we investigate the effect of disc structures on the lensing properties of early-type galaxies. Statistical properties, like magnification cross-sections and the expected number of quad (four-image) lens systems, are not affected greatly by the inclusion of discs that contain less than ~10 per cent of the total stellar mass.</TD>

Bulge SC1 proper motions (Sumi+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We report a measurement of the streaming motion of the stars in the Galactic bar with the red clump giants (RCGs) using the data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II). We measure the proper motion of 46961 stars and divide RCGs into bright and faint subsamples that on average will be closer to the near and far sides of the bar, respectively. We find that the far-side RCGs (4979 stars) have a proper motion of {Delta}&amp;lt;{mu}&amp;gt;~1.5+/-0.11mas/yr toward the negative longitudes relative to the near-side RCGs (3610 stars).</TD>

OGLE-II High proper motion stars (Eyer+, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
The difference image analysis (DIA) of the images obtained by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-II) revealed a peculiar artefact in the sample of stars proposed as variable by Woniak in one of the Galactic bulge fields: the occurrence of pairs of candidate variables showing anti-correlated light curves monotonic over a period of 3 yr. This effect can be understood, quantified and related to the stellar proper motions. DIA photometry supplemented with a simple model offers an effective and easy way to detect high proper motion stars in very dense stellar fields, where conventional astrometric searches are extremely inefficient.</TD>

SDSS quasar lens search (Oguri+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
We present an algorithm for selecting a uniform sample of gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.2) quasars brighter than i=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our algorithm uses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small- and large-separation lenses, respectively. Our selection algorithm only relies on parameters that the SDSS standard image processing pipeline generates, allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. The algorithm has been tested against simulated SDSS images, which adopt distributions of field and quasar parameters taken from the real SDSS data as input. Furthermore, we take differential reddening into account. We find that our selection algorithm is almost complete down to separations of 1&dquot; and flux ratios of 10^-0.5^.</TD>

QSO-candidates in OGLE-II Galactic bulge fields (Sumi+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present 97 QSO candidates in 48 Galactic bulge fields of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II) covering ~11deg^2^, which are selected via their variability. We extend light curves of variable objects which were detected in a 3-yr baseline in the OGLE-II variable star catalogue to fourth year. We search for objects that are faint (16&amp;lt;I_0_&amp;lt;18.5) and slowly variable over 4-yr in this catalogue by using the variogram/structure function. Finding the QSOs in such stellar-crowded and high extinction fields is challenging, but should be useful for the astrometric reference frame. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are required to confirm these QSO candidates. Follow-up observations are being prepared for four of these fields (BUL_SC1, 2, 32 and 45). Follow-up observations for other fields are strongly encouraged. The complete list and light curves of all 97 candidates are available in electronic format at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/sumi/QSO-OGLEII/ .</TD>

Multiple lensed images in MCS J1206.2-0847 (Zitrin+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
As part of the CLASH program, MACS1206 was observed with HST from 2011 March to 2011 July. This is 1 of 25 clusters to be observed to a depth of 20 HST orbits in 16 filters with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS and IR cameras, and the ACS WFC. We obtain spectra for a number of multiple systems uncovered here, taken as part of the VLT/VIMOS Large Programme 186.A-0798, which will perform panoramic spectroscopy of 14 southern CLASH clusters, targeting hundreds of cluster members per cluster and SL features in their cores. The spectra presented here are the results of the very first observations for this program, consisting of four pointings with the LR-Blue grism, obtained in 2011 March-April, which yielded approximately 1000 redshifts. This configuration provides a spectral resolution of ~28{AA} with 1&dquot; slits and a useful wavelength coverage of 3700-6800{AA}.</TD>

Flat-spectrum symmetric radio sources (Augusto+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
The radio sources listed below were selected from the Jodrell-VLA Astrometric Survey and the Cosmic-Lens All-Sky Survey (part 1) and constitute a (non-complete) parent sample for the selection of flat-spectrum symmetric object candidates (the ones which show structure, when their VLA-A 8.4GHz data are analysed). The parent sample contains northern hemisphere objects with 8.4GHz flux densities greater than 100mJy, galactic latitudes greater than 10 degrees and 1.40-to-4.85GHz spectral indices (when known; if not, the source is kept in the sample) smaller than 0.50 (flat). The most relevant properties of the parent sample are listed in the Table.</TD>

400d Cluster Survey Weak Lensing Programme II (Israel+ 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Here, we present the final stacked ``coadded&quot;&quot; analysed in the paper. The data set consists of observations of eight fields centred on galaxy clusters selected from the 400d survey (Burenin et al., 2007, Cat. J/ApJS/172/561, Vikhlinin et al. 2009ApJ...692.1033V). All of these clusters have been observed with the Megacam wide-field imager, then located at the 6.5m MMT telescope at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (files MMT*). The galaxy shapes analysed in our article were drawn from the r&quot; band images (*_r.fits), consistently. For four of the clusters, auxiliary bands (g&quot;, i&quot;) could be observed and taken into account for galaxy selection. Note that the r&quot; band of CL 0030+2618 and the g&quot; and r&quot; bands were taken in non-photometric conditions, while the rest of the data is of photometric quality. We also include observations obtained with the CFHT MegaCam/MegaPrime imager (files CFHT*) for CL 1701+6414 in the g&quot;r&quot;i&quot;z&quot; filters, which we analysed for comparison. Note that the exposure time of these images in accessible in the fits headers via the TEXPTIME keyword, not via EXPTIME. For all images, we also include the weight and flag images used in our analysis, giving the pixel-to-pixel quality variation in the main files and regions excluded from the analysis, respectively.</TD>

Gravitational lensing flexion in A1689 with an AIM (Cain+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Measuring dark matter substructure within galaxy cluster halos is a fundamental probe of the {Lambda}CDM model of structure formation. Gravitational lensing is a technique for measuring the total mass distribution which is independent of the nature of the gravitating matter, making it a vital tool for studying these dark-matter-dominated objects. We present a new method for measuring weak gravitational lensing flexion fields, the gradients of the lensing shear field, to measure mass distributions on small angular scales. While previously published methods for measuring flexion focus on measuring derived properties of the lensed images, such as shapelet coefficients or surface brightness moments, our method instead fits a mass-sheet transformation invariant Analytic Image Model (AIM) to each galaxy image. This simple parametric model traces the distortion of lensed image isophotes and constrains the flexion fields. We test the AIM method using simulated data images with realistic noise and a variety of unlensed image properties, and show that it successfully reproduces the input flexion fields. We also apply the AIM method for flexion measurement to Hubble Space Telescope observations of A1689 and detect mass structure in the cluster using flexion measured with this method. We also estimate the scatter in the measured flexion fields due to the unlensed shape of the background galaxies and find values consistent with previous estimates.</TD>

Optical properties of WISE galaxies (Hwang+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
The Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey (SHELS) is a magnitude-limited redshift survey covering the 4deg^2^ region of the DLS (Deep Lens Survey) F2 field (Geller et al. 2005ApJ...635L.125G, 2010ApJ...709..832G, 2012, Cat. J/AJ/143/102). The F2 field is one of the five fields and is centered on RA=09h19m32.4s and DE=+30:00:00. The DLS R-band images were taken in seeing 0.9&dquot;; the source detection on these images reaches down to 28.7mag/arcsec^2^. The spectroscopic observations for SHELS galaxies were conducted for galaxies down to Rmag=20.6 with the Hectospec 300 fiber spectrograph on the MMT (see Geller et al. 2012, Cat. J/AJ/143/102, for detailed description of the spectroscopic observations). The spectra cover the wavelength range 3650-9150{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}. We use the WISE all-sky survey catalog, which contains uniform photometric data for over 563 million objects at four MIR bands (3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22um). WISE covers the entire region of the SHELS field to a homogeneous depth.</TD>

Spectra of 13 lensed quasars (Sluse+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Extracted flux calibrated spectra of 13 lensed quasars following the methodology described in Sect. 2.1. of the oaoer. The data were obtained with the FORS spectrograph at VLT in multi-object spectroscopy mode. The typical wavelength coverage is from 4200 to 8200{AA}. The data concern the following objects: HE0047-1756 (HE0047), Q0142-100 (Q0142), SDSSJ0246-0825 (SDSS0246), HE0435-1223 (HE0435), SDSSJ0806+2006 (SDSS0806), FBQ0951+2635 (FBQ0951), BRI0952-0115 (BRI0952), SDSSJ1138+0314 (J1138), J1226-0006 (J1226), SDSSJ1335+0118 (J1335), Q1355-2257 (Q1355), WFI2033-4723 (WFI2033), and HE2149-2745 (HE2149). For each object, we provide the 1D flux calibrated spectrum of the 2 individual images in the slit. In addition, we also provide the 2D reduced spectrum and corresponding 1{sigma} error frame (corresponding files are named &dquot;objectname_data&dquot; and &dquot;objectname_err&dquot;), and the 2D processed spectra associated to the deconvolution, as shown in Fig.1 of the paper. These processed 2D spectra are the deconvolved frame (&dquot;_dec&dquot;), the extended component of the flux emission (&dquot;_ext&dquot;) and the residual frame in {sigma} units (&dquot;_res&dquot;) corresponding to panel (b), (c) and (d) of Fig.1. A pdf file file similar to Fig.1 is also provided for each object.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs. We analyze the radial distribution of quasars from pairs around galaxies of different types. We show that the quasars from pairs follow the density profile of halo globular clusters. This is new observational evidence that the quasars projected onto the halos of galaxies are magnified by gravitational lensing by halo globular clusters.</TD>

We present the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey-ARCS (SARCS) sample from the completed CFHTLS-WIDE and CFHTLS-DEEP covering a combined unmasked area of ~150deg^2^ in the sky. The lens sample is compiled through a semi-automatic technique consisting of using the ARCFINDER algorithm, followed by visual inspection and ranking of the candidates. We briefly described how ARCFINDER works (Alard 2006astro.ph..6757A) and the modifications implemented in the newer version of the algorithm.</TD>

VLBA calibrator survey: VCS1 catalog (Beasley+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
A catalog containing milli-arcsecond-accurate positions of 1332 extragalactic radio sources distributed over the northern sky is presented - the Very Long Baseline Array Calibrator Survey (VCS1). The positions have been derived from astrometric analysis of dual-frequency 2.3 and 8.4 GHz VLBA snapshot observations; in a majority of cases, images of the sources are also available. These radio sources are suitable for use in geodetic and astrometric experiments, and as phase-reference calibrators in high-sensitivity astronomical imaging. The VCS1 is the largest high-resolution radio survey ever undertaken and triples the number of sources available to the radio astronomy community for VLBI applications. In addition to the astrometric role, this survey can be used in active galactic nuclei, Galactic, gravitational lens, and cosmological studies.</TD>

We present a sample of microlensing events discovered in the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the OGLE-II images collected during three observing seasons, 1997-1999. 4424 light curves pass our criteria on the presence of a brightening episode on top of a constant baseline. Among those, 512 candidate microlensing events were selected visually. We designed an automated procedure, which unambiguously selects up to 237 best events. Including eight candidate events recovered by other means, a total of 520 light curves are presented in this work.</TD>

OGLE RR Lyrae VI photometry (Udalski, 1998)</TD>
<TD>
We analyze the mean luminosity of three samples of field RRab Lyr stars observed in the course of the OGLE microlensing experiment: 73 stars from the Galactic bulge and 110 and 128 stars from selected fields in the LMC and SMC, respectively. The fields are the same as in the recent distance determination to the Magellanic Clouds with the red clump stars method by Udalski et al. (1998AcA....48....1U). We determine the relative distance scale Galactic Bulge: 0.194+/-0.010; LMC: 1.00 ; SMC: 1.30+/-0.08. We calibrate our RR Lyr distance scale with the recent calibration of Gould and Popowski (1998ApJ...508..844G) based on statistical parallaxes. We obtain the following distance moduli to the Galactic bulge, LMC and SMC: m-M=14.5+/-0.15, m-M=18.09+/-0.16 and m-M=18.66+/-0.16mag.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We argue that globular clusters (GCs) are good candidates for gravitational lenses in explaining quasar-galaxy associations. The catalog of associations (Bukhmastova, 2001, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AZh/78/675&amp;gt;) compiled from the LEDA catalog of galaxies (Paturel, 1997A&amp;amp;AS..124..109P) and from the catalog of quasars (Veron-Cetty and Vero, 1998, see Cat. &amp;lt;VII/235&amp;gt;) is used. Based on the new catalog, we show that one might expect an increased number of GCs around irregular galaxies of types 9 and 10 from the hypothesis that distant compact sources are gravitationally lensed by GCs in the halos of foreground galaxies. The King model is used to determine the central surface densities of 135 GCs in the Milky Way. The distribution of GCs in central surface density was found to be lognormal.</TD>

Catalogue of eclipsing binaries in the SMC (Bayne+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
The catalogue lists 167 eclipsing binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud detected in the database of time-series photometry for 400000 SMC stars acquired by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) project during 1997. Coordinates, ephemerides, magnitudes and light curves are presented. Thirty-five systems are new detections. The limiting magnitude is about 17.5. The majority of periods lie within the range 0.4 to 20 days; 6 systems are possibly eccentric while 14 are probably or certainly so. The majority of the newly-identified systems lie in the outer regions of the SMC.</TD>

We observed a sample of 26 clusters with the Frederick C. Gillett Telescope (Gemini North) between 2008 February and 2010 June as part of Gemini programs GN-2008A-Q-25 and GN-2009A-Q-21. We obtained pre-imaging of 20 of the 26 clusters in gri with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). In addition to the Gemini/GMOS-North spectroscopy, we supplement our data set with cluster member redshift measurements made at the 3.5m Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) Telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, using the Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) in long-slit mode.</TD>

South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zeldovich Survey Point Source Catalog</TD>
<TD>
This table contains a a point-source catalog from 771 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel&quot;dovich (SPT-SZ) survey at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. 1,545 sources are detected above 4.5-sigma significance in at least one band. Based on their relative brightness between survey bands, the authors classify the sources into two populations, one dominated by synchrotron emission from active galactic nuclei, and one dominated by thermal emission from dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. They find 1,238 synchrotron and 307 dusty sources. The authors cross-match all sources against external catalogs and find 189 unidentified synchrotron sources and 189 unidentified dusty sources. The dusty sources without counterparts are good candidates for high-redshift, strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies. The authors derive number counts for each population from 1 Jy down to roughly 11, 4, and 11 mJy at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. They compare these counts with galaxy population models and find that none of the models they consider for either population provide a good fit to the measured counts in all three bands. The disparities imply that these measurements will be an important input to the next generation of millimeter-wave extragalactic source population models. The SPT is a 10-m telescope located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station in Antarctica. At 150 GHz (2 mm), the SPT has arcminute angular resolution and a 1 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; diffraction-limited field of view. The SPT was designed for high-sensitivity millimeter/sub-millimeter observations of faint, low-contrast sources, such as CMB anisotropies. The first survey with the SPT, designated as the SPT-SZ survey, was completed in 2011 November and covers a ~2500 deg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; region of the southern extragalactic sky in three frequency bands, 95, 150, and 220 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 3.2, 2.0, and 1.4 mm. The fields were surveyed to depths of approximately 40, 18, and 70 microK arcmin at 95, 150, and 220NASA/GSFC HEASARC</TD>

Million Quasars Catalog (MILLIQUAS), Version 3.3 (7 April 2013)</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the Million Quasars (MILLIQUAS) Catalog, Version 3.3 (7 April 2013). It is a compendium of all type I QSOs, AGNe, and BL Lacs in the literature, up to 6 April 2013; completeness is full or nearly so. High-confidence (70+%) photometric SDSS and radio/X-ray associated objects are included, which bring the total number of objects to 1,246,268. Objects have been de-duplicated across catalogs, and the earliest name and best redshift is presented for each. Astrometry is fixed onto a combined APM/USNO-A/SDSS optical background, and is accurate to within 1-2 arcseconds in every case. Astrometric corrections from the author&quot;s paper (2013,PASA,30,4) are also included. Note that lensed images and close objects images within 1.5 arcseconds may be represented as single objects. This version has the following changes from the previous edition: &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; (1) Quasar data brought up to publications as at 6 April 2013. (2) Individual quasar data from 2013,A&amp;amp;A,551,A29 &dquot;Quasar Luminosity Function from dedicated SDSS-III and MMT data&dquot; by N. Palanque-Delabrouille et al, have been kindly provided by the lead author. This adds 713 new quasars. (3) SWIRE data is now included, consisting of 117 confirmed quasars and &amp;gt;20K photometric quasars from Rowan-Robinson M. et al, 2013,MNRAS,428,1958. (4) The author&quot;s paper 2013-PASA-30-4 marked 9 QSOs as uncertainly located. Of those: (a) The author has found Q 0112-27 at J011446.4-271408, via 1RXS J011446.4-271419. (b) XSF3:29 is found at J034116.3-435748, via 2RXP J034116.6-435754. (c) RXS J11167-1711 found at J111645.6-171155, via 1RXS J111644.6-171135. (d) 1H 0828-706 is removed as there are no credible candidates. (5) 26 SDSS-DR9 quasars removed as inspection shows they are only artifacts. (6) Iovino et al, 1996 A&amp;amp;AS,119,265 presented 1581 quasar spectra of which 144 were marked by them as questionable (&quot;?&quot;). Those 144 are often anomalously bright and none show radio/X-ray associations. Those 144 are now removed. (7) Eight blazars without redshift have been droNASA/GSFC HEASARC</TD>

Submm observations in gravitational lenses (Knudsen+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We have conducted a submillimetre mapping survey of faint, gravitationally lensed sources, where we have targeted 12 galaxy clusters and additionally the New Technology Telescope (NTT) Deep Field. The total area surveyed is 71.5arcmin^2^ in the image plane; correcting for gravitational lensing, the total area surveyed is 40arcmin^2^ in the source plane for a typical source redshift z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;2.5. In the deepest maps, an image plane depth of 1{sigma} rms ~0.8mJy is reached. This survey is the largest survey to date to reach such depths. In total 59 sources were detected, including three multiply imaged sources. The gravitational lensing makes it possible to detect sources with flux density below the blank field confusion limit. The lensing-corrected fluxes range from 0.11 to 19mJy. After correcting for multiplicity, there are 10 sources with fluxes &amp;lt;2mJy of which seven have submJy fluxes, doubling the number of such sources known. Number counts are determined below the confusion limit. At 1mJy, the integrated number count is ~10^4^deg^-2^, and at 0.5mJy it is ~2x10^4^deg^-2^. Based on the number counts, at a source plan flux limit of 0.1mJy, essentially all of the 850-m background emission has been resolved. The dominant contribution (&amp;gt;50 per cent) to the integrated background arises from sources with fluxes S850 between 0.4 and 2.5mJy, while the bright sources S850&amp;gt;6mJy contribute only 10 per cent.</TD>

Multiply imaged gravitational lens systems (Limousin+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution of galaxy cluster Abell 1689 at z=0.18 using detected strong lensing features from deep ACS observations and extensive ground based spectroscopy. Earlier analyses have reported up to 32 multiply imaged systems in this cluster, of which only 3 were spectroscopically confirmed. In this work, we present a parametric strong lensing mass reconstruction using 34 multiply imaged systems of which 24 have newly determined spectroscopic redshifts, which is a major step forward in building a robust mass model. In turn, the new spectroscopic data allows a more secure identification of multiply imaged systems.</TD>

Variable Stars in the Large Magellanic Clouds (MACHO, 2001)</TD>
<TD>
The MACHO Project is a collaboration between scientists at the Mt. Stromlo &amp;amp; Siding Spring Observatories, the Center for Particle Astrophysics at the Santa Barbara, San Diego, &amp;amp; Berkeley campuses of the University of California, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The primary aim of the project is a search for dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way in the form of objects like brown dwarfs or planets also named MACHOs, for MAssive Compact Halo Objects. The signature of these MACHOs is the occasional amplification of the light from extragalactic stars by the gravitational lens effect. The amplification can be large, but events are extremely rare: it is necessary to monitor photometrically several million stars for a period of years in order to obtain a useful detection rate. The MACHO project is described by Alcock et al. (1992, in &dquot;Robotic Telescopes in the 1990s&dquot;, A.V. Fillippenko Ed., ASP Conf. Series 34, p.193). A dedicated 1.27-m telescope at Mount Stromlo, Australia is used to obtain observations of the LMC year-round, using a camera imaging a field of view of 0.5 square degrees at prime focus. Photometric observations of the LMC fields are obtained in two bandpasses simultaneously, using a dichroic beamsplitter to direct the blue (440-590nm) and red (590-780nm) light onto 2x2 mosaics of 2048x2048 Loral CCDs; the 15um pixels map to 0.63arcsec on the sky. The photometric reduction methods are detailed in Alcock et al. (1996ApJ...461...84A).</TD>

1998-2000 OGLE events microlensing limits (Tsapras+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
The data sets presented here were obtained from the DoPhot analysis of the events available at the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) website, ftp://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/olge . For the purposes of this analysis, we only considered the events for which the point-source point-lens (PSPL) model provided adequate fits. Out of a total of 162 events observed by the OGLE (Udalski, 1994ApJ...436L.103U) collaboration during a three-year period (1998-2000), we found that for 145 of these the reduced {chi}^2^ of the PSPL model fit, adjusting six parameters, approached a value of unity, indicating a good fit.</TD>

Strong and weak lensing analysis of A2261 (Coe+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We observed A2261 (17:22:27.2+32:07:57 (J2000) for the BCG, brightest cluster galaxy) as part of the CLASH program in HST cycle 18 between 2011 March 9 and May 21 to a total depth of 20 orbits in 16 WFC3 and ACS filters, spanning ~2000-17000{AA} (GO 12066; PI: Postman). The full 20-orbit, 16-filter depth is achieved over a central area of 3.9arcmin^2^, comfortably including all the strongly lensed galaxies. We targeted probable A2261 cluster members based on their proximity to the expected cluster red sequence and proximity to the BCG (K. Rines et al. 2013, Cat. J/ApJ/767/15) with the Hectospec instrument mounted on the 6.5m MMT. In addition, all targets were sufficiently bright with magnitudes 16&amp;lt;r&quot;&amp;lt;21 in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7. Our weak-lensing analysis is based on archival BJVJRC imaging obtained with the 34&quot;x27&quot; FOV Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2m telescope and NOAO archival MOSAIC1 i&quot;z&quot; imaging obtained with the Mayall 4m telescope at KPNO (program 2008A-0356, PI.

Galaxy clusters in the COSMOS field (Bellagamba+, 2011)</TD>
<TD>
Galaxy clusters are usually detected in blind optical surveys via suitable filtering methods. We present an optimal matched filter which maximizes their signal-to-noise ratio by taking advantage of the knowledge we have of their intrinsic physical properties and of the data noise properties. In this paper we restrict our application to galaxy magnitudes, positions and photometric redshifts if available, and we also apply the filter separately to weak lensing data. The method is suitable to be naturally extended to a multi-band approach which could include not only additional optical bands but also observables with different nature such as X-rays. For each detection, the filter provides its significance, an estimate for the richness and for the redshift even if photo-z are not given. The provided analytical error estimate is tested against numerical simulations. We finally apply our method to the COSMOS field and compare the results with previous cluster detections obtained with different methods. Our catalogue contains 27 galaxy clusters with minimal threshold at 3{sigma} level including both optical and weak-lensing information.</TD>

OGLEII high pm stars towards Galactic Centre (Rattenbury+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
The photometry data base of the second phase of the OGLE microlensing experiment, OGLE-II, is a rich source of information about the kinematics and structure of the Galaxy. In this work, we use the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue to identify candidate stars which have high proper motions. 521 stars with proper motion {mu}&amp;gt;50mas/yr in the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue were cross-identified with stars in the MACHO high proper motion catalogue, and the DEep Near-Infrared Survey and Two-Micron All-Sky Survey infrared photometry catalogues. Photometric distances were computed for stars with colours consistent with G/K- and M-type stars. Six stars were newly identified as possible nearby (&amp;lt;50pc) M dwarfs.</TD>

NOT GL survey of multiply imaged quasars (Jaunsen+, 1995)</TD>
<TD>
A gravitational lens (GL)-search program, initiated in 1990 at the Nordic Optcal Telescope (NOT), has revealed several possible GL-candidates among a sample of 168 quasars (QSOs), chosen from three lists compiled by C. Hazard, D. Reimers and J. Surdej, respectively. Some of these candidates, selected for having close companions (within 5 arcseconds), were imaged in several filters and their colours compared. Low dispersion spectra of the most promising candidates were also obtained at the NOT and ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT). None of these has proved to be strong candidates of gravitational lensing effects. We present this new sample of QSOs and combine it with previously published optical QSO samples in a statistical analysis to yield constraints on flat cosmologies and galaxy velocity dispersions.</TD>

Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) Exposures Log</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) log of exposures having observation type = &quot;OBJECT&quot; (those with &quot;BIAS&quot;, &quot;FLAT&quot; and other types are not included) which have been made since April 2001. Note that from the version of Nov. 2005 on, the number of rows has significantly increased because those data with worse position determination (up to 30 arcsec error) are now included. The data currently extend to November 2005 and it is anticipated that they will be regularly updated Suprime-Cam is an 80-mega pixels (10240 x 8192) mosaic CCD camera, for the wide-field prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34&quot; x 27&quot;, a unique facility among the 8-10m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0.202 arcseconds per pixel. The focal plane consists of ten high-resistivity 2kx2k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which are cooled by a large Stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. A filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type is designed that can hold up to ten large filters (205 x 170 x 15 mm^3). The wide-field corrector is basically a three-lens Wynne-type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector. The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of 30&quot; in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller than 30 um peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image over the entire field. The median seeing in the I_c-band, measured over one year and a half, is 0.61 arcseconds. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the time of its commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging.

Photometry and lines of (z~0.2-1.0) galaxies (Lamareille+, 2006)</TD>
<TD>
We present the spectrophotometric properties of a sample of 141 emission-line galaxies at redshifts in the range 0.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;1.0 with a peak around 0.2&amp;lt;=z&amp;lt;=0.4. The analysis is based on medium resolution (Rs=500-600), optical spectra obtained at VLT and Keck. The targets are mostly &dquot;Canada-France Redshift Survey&dquot; (&amp;lt;VII/225&amp;gt;) emission-line galaxies, with the addition of field galaxies randomly selected behind lensing clusters. We complement this sample with galaxy spectra from the &dquot;Gemini Deep Deep Survey&dquot; (&amp;lt;J/AJ/127/2455&amp;gt;) public data release. We have computed absolute magnitudes of the galaxies and measured the line fluxes and equivalent widths of the main emission/absorption lines. The last two have been measured after careful subtraction of the fitted stellar continuum using the platefit software originally developed for the SDSS and adapted to our data. We present a careful comparison of this software with the results of manual measurements.</TD>

Abundances of microlensed Bulge dwarf stars. V. (Bensby+, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
For each spectral line we give the lower excitation potential, measured equivalent widths, and derived absolute abundances. We also give median abundances for each star, normalised to the Sun, and errors in the median abundances. These tables contain data for all so far 58 microlensed dwarf stars, and superseeds the tables in Bensby+ (2009, Cat. J/A+A/499/737), Bensby+ (2010, Cat. J/A+A/512/A41), and Bensby+ (2011, Cat.

VLBA imaging and polarimetry survey at 5GHz (Helmboldt+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
We have chosen the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS; Myers et al. 2003, Cat. &amp;lt;VIII/72&amp;gt;) as our parent sample. We have also restricted our sample to lie on the survey area, of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Among our target list, 141 have already been observed at 5 GHz with the VLBA as part of the Caltech-Jordell Bank Flat-Spectrum survey (CJF; Taylor et al., 1996ApJS..107...37T; Pollack et al., 2003, Cat. &amp;lt;J/ApJ/589/733&amp;gt;), eight have been or will be observed at 15GHz as part of the Monitoring of Jets in AGNs with VLBA Experiments (MOJAVE) project (Lister &amp;amp; Homan, 2005, Cat. &amp;lt;J/AJ/130/1389&amp;gt;), and 20 were observed for the VIPS pilot program at 5 and 15GHz (Taylor et al., 2005ApJS..159...27T). Each of these surveys contains VLBA observations at 5 or 15GHz that have adequate sensitivity for our purposes. The remaining 958 sources were observed with the VLBA within 18 separate observing runs of approximately 11hr each from 2006 January to August.</TD>

VeronCatalogofQuasars&amp;amp;AGN,13thEdition</TD>
<TD>
This database table contains the 13th edition of the Catalog of Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei by Veron-Cetty and Veron, and is an update of the previous versions. As in the previous editions, no information about absorption lines or X-ray properties is given, but absolute magnitides are provided, assuming a Hubble constant H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 71 km/s/Mpc and a deceleration parameter q&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0 (notice the change of cosmology from previous editions in which H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; was assumed to be 50 km/s/Mpc). The present edition of this catalog contains 133336 quasars, 1374 BL Lac objects and 34231 active galaxies (including 15627 Seyfert 1 galaxies), for a grand total of 168941 objects, significantly more than the number of objects listed in the 12th edition (108080). The 13th edition includes positions and redshifts, as well as photometry (U, B, and V) and 6-cm and 20-cm flux densities, when available. 178 objects once proposed but now rejected as quasars are NOT included in the online version of this catalog: their names and positions are listed in the file &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/258/reject.dat&dquot;&amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/258/reject.dat&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This HEASARC table also does NOT contain the additional information on gravitationally lensed quasars and quasar pairs listed in Tables 3 and 4 of the published paper: these tables are available in electronic form at the CDS &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/248/&dquot;&amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/248/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; files table2.dat and table3.dat (sic).

Spectroscopy of bright M dwarfs in the northern sky (Lepine+, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
Targets for the follow-up spectroscopic program were selected from the catalog of 8889 bright M dwarfs of Lepine &amp;amp; Gaidos (2011, cat. J/AJ/142/138). All stars are selected from the SUPERBLINK catalog of stars (Lepine &amp;amp; Shara, 2005, cat. I/298) with proper motions {mu}&amp;gt;40mas/yr. Of the 1564 M dwarf candidates, we found that 286 had been observed at the MDM observatory by one of us (SL) prior to 2008 November, as part of a separate spectroscopic follow-up survey of very nearby (d&amp;lt;20pc) stars (Alpert &amp;amp; Lepine, 2011AAS...21724211A). The remaining targets were distributed between our observing teams at the MDM Observatory and University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope (UH22), with the MDM team in charge of higher declination targets ({delta}&amp;gt;30) and the UH22 team in charge of the lower declination range (0&amp;lt;{delta}&amp;lt;30). Spectra were collected at the MDM observatory in a series of 22 observing runs scheduled between 2002 June and 2012 April. Most of the spectra were collected at the McGraw-Hill 1.3m telescope, but a number were obtained at the neighboring Hiltner 2.4m telescope. Two different spectrographs were used: the MkIII spectrograph, and the CCDS spectrograph. Both are facility instruments which provide low- to medium-resolution spectroscopy in the optical regime. Their operation at either 1.3m or 2.4m telescopes is identical. Data were collected in slit spectroscopy mode, with an effective slit width of 1.0&dquot; to 1.5&dquot;. The MkIII spectrograph was used with two different gratings: the 300l/mm grating blazed at 8000{AA}, providing a spectral resolution R~2000, and the 600l/mm grating blazed at 5800{AA}, which provides R~4000. The two gratings were used with either one of two thick-chip CCD cameras (Wilbur and Nellie) both having negligible fringing in the red. Spectra for a total of 901 bright M dwarf targets were collected at MDM. Additional spectra were obtained with the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope on Mauna Kea between 2009 February anCDS</TD>

Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) Exposures Log</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) log of exposures having observation type = &quot;OBJECT&quot; (those with &quot;BIAS&quot;, &quot;FLAT&quot; and other types are not included) which have been made since April 2001. Note that from the version of Nov. 2005 on, the number of rows has significantly increased because those data with worse position determination (up to 30 arcsec error) are now included. The data currently extend to November 2005 and it is anticipated that they will be regularly updated Suprime-Cam is an 80-mega pixels (10240 x 8192) mosaic CCD camera, for the wide-field prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34&quot; x 27&quot;, a unique facility among the 8-10m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0.202 arcseconds per pixel. The focal plane consists of ten high-resistivity 2kx2k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which are cooled by a large Stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. A filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type is designed that can hold up to ten large filters (205 x 170 x 15 mm^3). The wide-field corrector is basically a three-lens Wynne-type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector. The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of 30&quot; in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller than 30 um peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image over the entire field. The median seeing in the I_c-band, measured over one year and a half, is 0.61 arcseconds. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the time of its commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging.

The Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) is a 60 night NOAO (National Optical Astronomy Observatory) imaging survey program (2005-2008), using the Mosaic-II camera on the Blanco 4m telescope at CTIO (Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory), which has uniformly imaged 75deg^2^ of the sky in the SDSS griz bands. Observations of the lens, which is a rich cluster containing a prominent central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), were made with BCS imaging on 2006 Oct 30 (iz bands), 2006 Dec 14 (gr bands) and 2008 Nov 11 (gr bands) and with Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on 2007 Aug 4 and 14. We obtained GMOS spectra of the source and a number of neighboring galaxies (Lin et al. 2007, Gemini Proposal GS-2007B-Q-228).</TD>

Planck submillimetre sources in Virgo Cluster (Baes+, 2014)</TD>
<TD>
We cross-correlate the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS) with the fully sampled 84deg^2^ Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) fields. We search for and identify the 857 and 545GHz PCCS sources in the HeViCS fields by studying their FIR/submm and optical counterparts. We find 84 and 48 compact Planck sources in the HeViCS fields at 857 and 545GHz, respectively. Almost all sources correspond to individual bright Virgo Cluster galaxies. The vast majority of the Planck detected galaxies are late-type spirals, with the Sc class dominating the numbers, while early-type galaxies are virtually absent from the sample, especially at 545GHz. We compare the HeViCS SPIRE flux densities for the detected galaxies with the four different PCCS flux density estimators and find an excellent correlation with the aperture photometry flux densities, even at the highest flux density levels. We find only seven PCCS sources in the HeViCS fields without a nearby galaxy as obvious counterpart, and conclude that all of these are dominated by Galactic cirrus features or are spurious detections. No Planck sources in the HeViCS fields seem to be associated to high-redshift proto-clusters of dusty galaxies or strongly lensed submm sources. Finally, our study is the first empirical confirmation of the simulation-based estimated completeness of the PCCS, and provides a strong support of the internal PCCS validation procedure.</TD>

OGLE SMC BVI photometry (Udalski+ 1998)</TD>
<TD>
We present three color, BVI maps of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The maps contain precise photometric and astrometric data for about 2.2million stars from the central regions of the SMC bar covering ~2.4 square degrees on the sky. Mean brightness of stars is derived from observations collected in the course of the OGLE-II microlensing search from about 130, 30 and 15 measurements in the I, V and B-bands, respectively. Accuracy of the zero points of photometry is about 0.01mag, and astrometry 0.15arcsec (with possible systematic error up to 0.7arcsec). Color magnitude diagrams of observed fields are also presented. The maps of the SMC are the first from the series of similar maps covering other OGLE fields: LMC, Galactic bulge and Galactic disk. The data are very well suited for many projects, particularly for the SMC which has been neglected photometrically for years.</TD>

Strong and weak lensing analysis of A2261 (Coe+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
We observed A2261 (17:22:27.2+32:07:57 (J2000) for the BCG, brightest cluster galaxy) as part of the CLASH program in HST cycle 18 between 2011 March 9 and May 21 to a total depth of 20 orbits in 16 WFC3 and ACS filters, spanning ~2000-17000{AA} (GO 12066; PI: Postman). The full 20-orbit, 16-filter depth is achieved over a central area of 3.9arcmin^2^, comfortably including all the strongly lensed galaxies. We targeted probable A2261 cluster members based on their proximity to the expected cluster red sequence and proximity to the BCG (K. Rines et al. 2013, Cat. J/ApJ/767/15) with the Hectospec instrument mounted on the 6.5m MMT. In addition, all targets were sufficiently bright with magnitudes 16&amp;lt;r&quot;&amp;lt;21 in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7. Our weak-lensing analysis is based on archival BJVJRC imaging obtained with the 34&quot;x27&quot; FOV Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2m telescope and NOAO archival MOSAIC1 i&quot;z&quot; imaging obtained with the Mayall 4m telescope at KPNO (program 2008A-0356, PI.

SDSS Quasar Lens Search. IV. (Inada+, 2010)</TD>
<TD>
The 136 lensed quasar candidates taken from the 13,636 quasars constitute our targets for follow-up observations, but we remove two candidates that have already been examined. One is the morphologically selected candidate SDSS J111816.95+074558.1 which is the well-known lensed quasar PG1115+080 (Weymann et al. 1980Natur.285..641W). The other is the color-selected candidate SDSS J165502.02+260516.5, which is a pair of quasars with slightly different redshifts from SDSS spectroscopy. The remaining 134 candidates were observed as described in what follows using various telescopic facilities. The observations include optical and/or near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy, and are tabulated in Tables 2 and 3.</TD>

QSO-candidates in OGLE-II Galactic bulge fields (Sumi+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We present 97 QSO candidates in 48 Galactic bulge fields of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II) covering ~11deg^2^, which are selected via their variability. We extend light curves of variable objects which were detected in a 3-yr baseline in the OGLE-II variable star catalogue to fourth year. We search for objects that are faint (16&amp;lt;I_0_&amp;lt;18.5) and slowly variable over 4-yr in this catalogue by using the variogram/structure function. Finding the QSOs in such stellar-crowded and high extinction fields is challenging, but should be useful for the astrometric reference frame. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are required to confirm these QSO candidates. Follow-up observations are being prepared for four of these fields (BUL_SC1, 2, 32 and 45). Follow-up observations for other fields are strongly encouraged. The complete list and light curves of all 97 candidates are available in electronic format at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/sumi/QSO-OGLEII/ .</TD>

Redshift survey in the Subaru GTO2deg^2^ field (Kurtz+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Miyazaki et al. (2002ApJ...580L..97M, 2007, Cat. J/ApJ/669/714) used the 8.2m Subaru Telescope to carry out a weak-lensing survey of 13 well-separated fields covering a total of 21.82deg^2^. They used lensing convergence maps to identify 100 candidate halos with S/N {nu}&amp;gt;3.7; 10 of these candidates are within the GTO2deg^2^ field we examined here. We constructed the galaxy catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008, Cat. II/294) r-band galaxy list for the GTO2deg^2^ field. We acquired spectra for the objects with the Hectospec, a 300-fiber robotic instrument mounted on the MMT from 2009 February 1 to 2009 April 27. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3500-10000{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}.</TD>

2002-2007 PLANET microlensing events (Assan+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
Most known extrasolar planets (exoplanets) have been discovered using the radial velocity or transit methods. Both are biased towards planets that are relatively close to their parent stars, and studies find that around 17-30% of solar-like stars host a planet. Gravitational microlensing on the other hand, probes planets that are further away from their stars. Recently, a population of planets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered by microlensing. These planets are at least as numerous as the stars in the Milky Way. Here we report a statistical analysis of microlensing data (gathered in 2002-07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5-10AU (Sun-Earth distance) from their stars. We find that of stars host Jupiter-mass planets (0.3-10M_J_, where M_J_=318M_{earth}_ and M_{earth}_ is Earth&quot;s mass). Cool Neptunes (10-30M_{earth}_) and super-Earths (5-10M_{earth}_) are even more common: their respective abundances per star are 52^+22^_-29_% and 62^+35^_-37_%. We conclude that stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception.</TD>

VLBA calibrator survey: VCS1 catalog (Beasley+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
A catalog containing milli-arcsecond-accurate positions of 1332 extragalactic radio sources distributed over the northern sky is presented - the Very Long Baseline Array Calibrator Survey (VCS1). The positions have been derived from astrometric analysis of dual-frequency 2.3 and 8.4 GHz VLBA snapshot observations; in a majority of cases, images of the sources are also available. These radio sources are suitable for use in geodetic and astrometric experiments, and as phase-reference calibrators in high-sensitivity astronomical imaging. The VCS1 is the largest high-resolution radio survey ever undertaken and triples the number of sources available to the radio astronomy community for VLBI applications. In addition to the astrometric role, this survey can be used in active galactic nuclei, Galactic, gravitational lens, and cosmological studies.</TD>

Million Quasars Catalog (MILLIQUAS), Version 3.3 (7 April 2013)</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the Million Quasars (MILLIQUAS) Catalog, Version 3.3 (7 April 2013). It is a compendium of all type I QSOs, AGNe, and BL Lacs in the literature, up to 6 April 2013; completeness is full or nearly so. High-confidence (70+%) photometric SDSS and radio/X-ray associated objects are included, which bring the total number of objects to 1,246,268. Objects have been de-duplicated across catalogs, and the earliest name and best redshift is presented for each. Astrometry is fixed onto a combined APM/USNO-A/SDSS optical background, and is accurate to within 1-2 arcseconds in every case. Astrometric corrections from the author&quot;s paper (2013,PASA,30,4) are also included. Note that lensed images and close objects images within 1.5 arcseconds may be represented as single objects. This version has the following changes from the previous edition: &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; (1) Quasar data brought up to publications as at 6 April 2013. (2) Individual quasar data from 2013,A&amp;amp;A,551,A29 &dquot;Quasar Luminosity Function from dedicated SDSS-III and MMT data&dquot; by N. Palanque-Delabrouille et al, have been kindly provided by the lead author. This adds 713 new quasars. (3) SWIRE data is now included, consisting of 117 confirmed quasars and &amp;gt;20K photometric quasars from Rowan-Robinson M. et al, 2013,MNRAS,428,1958. (4) The author&quot;s paper 2013-PASA-30-4 marked 9 QSOs as uncertainly located. Of those: (a) The author has found Q 0112-27 at J011446.4-271408, via 1RXS J011446.4-271419. (b) XSF3:29 is found at J034116.3-435748, via 2RXP J034116.6-435754. (c) RXS J11167-1711 found at J111645.6-171155, via 1RXS J111644.6-171135. (d) 1H 0828-706 is removed as there are no credible candidates. (5) 26 SDSS-DR9 quasars removed as inspection shows they are only artifacts. (6) Iovino et al, 1996 A&amp;amp;AS,119,265 presented 1581 quasar spectra of which 144 were marked by them as questionable (&quot;?&quot;). Those 144 are often anomalously bright and none show radio/X-ray associations. Those 144 are now removed. (7) Eight blazars without redshift have been droNASA/GSFC HEASARC</TD>

Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (13th Ed.) (Veron+ 2010)</TD>
<TD>
This catalogue is a compilation of all known AGNs presented in a compact and convenient form. It is an update of the previous versions; and as in the previous editions no information about absorption lines of X-ray properties are given, but absolute magnitudes are given, assuming Ho=71km/s/Mpc and q_0_=0 (notice the change of cosmology: Ho was assumed to be 50km/s/Mpc in the previous editions). When available, the 20cm and 6cm radio flux are given. The present edition of this catalogue contains the quasars with measured redshift known prior to July 1st, 2009. It contains 133336 quasars, 1374 BL Lac objects and 34231 active galaxies (including 15627 Seyfert 1&quot;s), almost doubling the number listed in the 12th edition. Lists of known lensed quasars (table2.dat) and double quasars (table3.dat) are also given here.</TD>

OGLE2 Mira variables in the Galactic bulge (Matsunaga+, 2005)</TD>
<TD>
We have extracted a total of 1968 Mira variables from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment II (OGLE-II) data base in the Galactic bulge region. Among them, 1960 are associated with 2 Micron All-sky Survey (2MASS) sources, and 1541 are further identified with Midcourse Space Exploration (MSX) point sources. Their photometric properties are compared with those of Mira variables in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We have found that mass-losing stars with circumstellar matter are reddened such that the colour dependence of the absorption coefficient is similar to that of interstellar matter. We also discuss the structure of the bulge. The surface number density of the bulge Mira variables is well correlated with the 2.2-m surface brightness obtained by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. Using this relation, the total number of Mira variables in the bulge is estimated to be about 6x10^5^. The logP-K relation of the Mira variables gives their space distribution which supports the well-known asymmetry of the bar-like bulge.</TD>

VRc observations of LMC long-period red variables (Noda+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
146 long-period red variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the three-year Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) project data base were analysed. A careful periodic analysis was performed on these stars and a catalogue of their magnitudes, colours, periods and amplitudes is presented. We convert our blue and red magnitudes to K-band values using 19 oxygen-rich stars. A group of red short-period stars separated from the Mira sequence has been found on a (log P,K) diagram. They are located at the short period side of the Mira sequence consistent with the work of Wood &amp;amp; Sebo (1996MNRAS.282..958W). There are two interpretations for such stars; a difference in pulsation mode or a difference in chemical composition. We investigated the properties of these stars together with their colour, amplitude and periodicity. We conclude that they have small amplitudes and less regular variability. They are likely to be higher-mode pulsators. A large scatter has also been found on the long-period side of the (logP,K) diagram. This is possibly a systematic spread given that the blue band of our photometric system covers both standard B and V bands and affects carbon-rich stars.</TD>

Submm observations in gravitational lenses (Knudsen+, 2008)</TD>
<TD>
We have conducted a submillimetre mapping survey of faint, gravitationally lensed sources, where we have targeted 12 galaxy clusters and additionally the New Technology Telescope (NTT) Deep Field. The total area surveyed is 71.5arcmin^2^ in the image plane; correcting for gravitational lensing, the total area surveyed is 40arcmin^2^ in the source plane for a typical source redshift z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;2.5. In the deepest maps, an image plane depth of 1{sigma} rms ~0.8mJy is reached. This survey is the largest survey to date to reach such depths. In total 59 sources were detected, including three multiply imaged sources. The gravitational lensing makes it possible to detect sources with flux density below the blank field confusion limit. The lensing-corrected fluxes range from 0.11 to 19mJy. After correcting for multiplicity, there are 10 sources with fluxes &amp;lt;2mJy of which seven have submJy fluxes, doubling the number of such sources known. Number counts are determined below the confusion limit. At 1mJy, the integrated number count is ~10^4^deg^-2^, and at 0.5mJy it is ~2x10^4^deg^-2^. Based on the number counts, at a source plan flux limit of 0.1mJy, essentially all of the 850-m background emission has been resolved. The dominant contribution (&amp;gt;50 per cent) to the integrated background arises from sources with fluxes S850 between 0.4 and 2.5mJy, while the bright sources S850&amp;gt;6mJy contribute only 10 per cent.</TD>

OGLE microlensing events in Galactic Bulge (Udalski+, 2000)</TD>
<TD>
We present the Catalog of microlensing events detected toward the Galactic bulge in three observing seasons, 1997-1999, during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. The search for microlensing events was performed using a database of about 4x10^9^ photometric measurements of about 20.5 million stars from the Galactic bulge. The Catalog comprises 214 microlensing events found in the fields covering about 11 square degrees on the sky and distributed in different parts of the Galactic bulge. The sample includes 20 binary microlensing events, 14 of them are caustic crossing. In one case a double star is likely lensed. We present distribution of the basic parameters of microlensing events and show preliminary rate of microlensing in different regions of the Galactic bulge. The latter reveals clear dependence on the Galactic coordinates. The dependence on l indicates that the majority of lenses toward the Galactic bulge are located in the Galactic bar. Models of the Galactic bar seem to reasonably predict the observed spatial distribution of microlensing events in the Galactic bulge. All data presented in the Catalog and photometry of all events are available from the OGLE Internet archive.</TD>

Radio identification of EGRET sources (Mattox+ 1997)</TD>
<TD>
We present a method to assess the reliability of the identification of EGRET sources with extragalactic radio sources. We verify that EGRET is detecting the blazar class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However many published identifications are found to be questionable. We provide a table of 42 blazars that we expect to be robust identifications of EGRET sources. This includes one previously unidentified EGRET source, the lensed AGN PKS 1830-210, near the direction of the Galactic center. We provide the best available positions for 16 more radio sources that are also potential identifications for previously unidentified EGRET sources. All high Galactic latitude EGRET sources (|b|&amp;gt;3) that demonstrate significant variability can be identified with flat-spectrum radio sources. This suggests that EGRET is not detecting any type of AGN other than blazars. This identification method has been used to establish with 99.998% confidence that the peak gamma-ray flux of a blazar is correlated with its average 5GHz radio flux. An even better correlation is seen between gamma-ray flux and the 2.29GHz flux density measured with VLBI at the base of the radio jet. Also, using high-confidence identifications, we find that the radio sources identified with EGRET sources have greater correlated VLBI flux densities than the parent population of flat radio spectrum sources.</TD>

Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) Exposures Log</TD>
<TD>
This table contains the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) log of exposures having observation type = &quot;OBJECT&quot; (those with &quot;BIAS&quot;, &quot;FLAT&quot; and other types are not included) which have been made since April 2001. Note that from the version of Nov. 2005 on, the number of rows has significantly increased because those data with worse position determination (up to 30 arcsec error) are now included. The data currently extend to November 2005 and it is anticipated that they will be regularly updated Suprime-Cam is an 80-mega pixels (10240 x 8192) mosaic CCD camera, for the wide-field prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34&quot; x 27&quot;, a unique facility among the 8-10m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0.202 arcseconds per pixel. The focal plane consists of ten high-resistivity 2kx2k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which are cooled by a large Stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. A filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type is designed that can hold up to ten large filters (205 x 170 x 15 mm^3). The wide-field corrector is basically a three-lens Wynne-type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector. The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of 30&quot; in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller than 30 um peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image over the entire field. The median seeing in the I_c-band, measured over one year and a half, is 0.61 arcseconds. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the time of its commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging.

Gravitational arc candidates in the CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey</TD>
<TD>
Candidate gravitational arcs in the 37 deg^2 of CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey (CARS). The data include their post-stamp images, astrometry, photometry (u*,g&quot;,r&quot;,i&quot;), geometric properties (length, length-to-width ratio, profile curvature, area), and photometric redshifts. The arc candidates were selected booth with an automatic arcfinder, based on a tailored image segmentation and a color selection, and by visually inspecting the survey.</TD>

OGLE eclipsing binaries in LMC (Wyrzykowski+, 2003)</TD>
<TD>
We present the catalog of 2580 eclipsing binary stars detected in 4.6 square degree area of the central parts of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The photometric data were collected during the second phase of the OGLE microlensing search from 1997 to 2000. The eclipsing objects were selected with the automatic search algorithm based on an artificial neural network. Basic statistics of eclipsing stars are presented. Also, the list of 36 candidates of detached eclipsing binaries for spectroscopic study and for precise LMC distance determination is provided. The full catalog is accessible from the OGLE Internet archive.</TD>

HST observations of Extremely Red Objects (Smith+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
We present the results of a survey for extremely red objects (EROs) undertaken in the fields of 10 massive galaxy cluster lenses at z~0.2, combining sensitive, high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging with deep, half-arcsecond K-band imaging from UKIRT. We detect 60 EROs with (R-K)&amp;gt;=5.3, of which 26 have (R-K)&amp;gt;=6.0 in a total image-plane survey area of 49arcmin2 down to K=20.6, including one multiply imaged ERO.</TD>

Catalogue of eclipsing binaries in the SMC (Bayne+, 2002)</TD>
<TD>
The catalogue lists 167 eclipsing binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud detected in the database of time-series photometry for 400000 SMC stars acquired by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) project during 1997. Coordinates, ephemerides, magnitudes and light curves are presented. Thirty-five systems are new detections. The limiting magnitude is about 17.5. The majority of periods lie within the range 0.4 to 20 days; 6 systems are possibly eccentric while 14 are probably or certainly so. The majority of the newly-identified systems lie in the outer regions of the SMC.</TD>

Globular clusters as gravitational lenses (Bukhmastova+, 2007)</TD>
<TD>
Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs. We analyze the radial distribution of quasars from pairs around galaxies of different types. We show that the quasars from pairs follow the density profile of halo globular clusters. This is new observational evidence that the quasars projected onto the halos of galaxies are magnified by gravitational lensing by halo globular clusters.</TD>

We present a catalog of secondary photometric standard stars in the neighborhood of 14 gravitationally lensed quasars. These stars were verified to be non variable using long-term monitoring. The instrumental magnitudes of the new standard stars have been transformed to the Johnson-Cousins BV(RI)c photometric system. For ten gravitational lenses (GLs) we also provide the BV(RI)c mean magnitudes of the integrated flux of all the lens components, for the epochs of the photometric calibration.</TD>

SHELS galaxies with 0.02&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.1 (Geller+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
The Deep Lens Survey (DLS, Wittman et al., 2006ApJ...643..128W) is an National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) key program covering 20deg^2^ in five separate fields; we use the 4deg^2^ F2 field at {alpha}=09h19m32.4s and {delta}=+30{deg}00&quot;00&dquot;. The DLS photometry offers the possibility of identifying galaxies with lower surface brightness. Photometric observations of F2 were made with the MOSAIC I imager on the KPNO Mayall 4m telescope between 1999 November and 2004 November. We constructed a galaxy catalog from the R-band source list in F2. We selected galaxy candidates with Kron-Cousins R&amp;lt;=20.6 for spectroscopic observation. SHELS (Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey, Geller et al., 2005ApJ...635L.125G, 2010ApJ...709..832G) is a redshift survey covering the DLS survey F2 field. The SHELS spectra cover the wavelength range 3700-9100{AA} with a resolution of ~6{AA}. SHELS contains 541 galaxies with R&amp;lt;=20.6 at z&amp;lt;=0.1. We acquired spectra for the objects with the Hectospec on the MMT from 2004 April 13 to 2007 April 20.</TD>

Multiple lensed images in MCS J1206.2-0847 (Zitrin+, 2012)</TD>
<TD>
As part of the CLASH program, MACS1206 was observed with HST from 2011 March to 2011 July. This is 1 of 25 clusters to be observed to a depth of 20 HST orbits in 16 filters with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS and IR cameras, and the ACS WFC. We obtain spectra for a number of multiple systems uncovered here, taken as part of the VLT/VIMOS Large Programme 186.A-0798, which will perform panoramic spectroscopy of 14 southern CLASH clusters, targeting hundreds of cluster members per cluster and SL features in their cores. The spectra presented here are the results of the very first observations for this program, consisting of four pointings with the LR-Blue grism, obtained in 2011 March-April, which yielded approximately 1000 redshifts. This configuration provides a spectral resolution of ~28{AA} with 1&dquot; slits and a useful wavelength coverage of 3700-6800{AA}.</TD>

The radio sources listed below were selected from the Jodrell-VLA Astrometric Survey and the Cosmic-Lens All-Sky Survey (part 1) and constitute a (non-complete) parent sample for the selection of flat-spectrum symmetric object candidates (the ones which show structure, when their VLA-A 8.4GHz data are analysed). The parent sample contains northern hemisphere objects with 8.4GHz flux densities greater than 100mJy, galactic latitudes greater than 10 degrees and 1.40-to-4.85GHz spectral indices (when known; if not, the source is kept in the sample) smaller than 0.50 (flat). The most relevant properties of the parent sample are listed in the Table.</TD>

Massive clusters in the LMC (Baumgardt+, 2013)</TD>
<TD>
We use four recent compilations of LMC star cluster parameters to derive a combined catalogue for LMC clusters. Our first catalogue is the recent work of Glatt et al. (2010, Cat. J/A+A/517/A50), who used data from the MCPS together with isochrone fitting to derive ages and luminosities for 1193 populous star clusters in a 64deg^2^ area of the LMC. The second data set that we use is the catalogue of Pietrzynski &amp;amp; Udalski (2200, Cat. J/AcA/50/337), who used BVI data from the OGLE II microlensing experiment (Udalski et al., 1998, Cat, J/AcA/48/147) together with isochrone fitting to derive ages of about 600 star clusters which are located in the central parts of the LMC and are younger than 1.2Gyr. Our third catalogue is the cluster catalogue presented by Hunter et al. (2003AJ....126.1836H). The Hunter et al. catalogue contains data for about 746 different LMC clusters, limited to the inner regions of the LMC and to absolute luminosities brighter than M_V_=-3.5. In order to increase the accuracy of the age and mass determinations especially for bright clusters, we also include age determinations from the literature. In particular, we use the ages recently derived by Milone et al. (2009A&amp;amp;A...499..755V) for massive intermediate-age star clusters from colour-magnitude fitting and the age data compiled by Mackey &amp;amp; Gilmore (2003MNRAS.338...85M) for 53 massive LMC clusters.</TD>

<TD>
This database table contains the 13th edition of the Catalog of Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei by Veron-Cetty and Veron, and is an update of the previous versions. As in the previous editions, no information about absorption lines or X-ray properties is given, but absolute magnitides are provided, assuming a Hubble constant H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 71 km/s/Mpc and a deceleration parameter q&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0 (notice the change of cosmology from previous editions in which H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; was assumed to be 50 km/s/Mpc). The present edition of this catalog contains 133336 quasars, 1374 BL Lac objects and 34231 active galaxies (including 15627 Seyfert 1 galaxies), for a grand total of 168941 objects, significantly more than the number of objects listed in the 12th edition (108080). The 13th edition includes positions and redshifts, as well as photometry (U, B, and V) and 6-cm and 20-cm flux densities, when available. 178 objects once proposed but now rejected as quasars are NOT included in the online version of this catalog: their names and positions are listed in the file &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/258/reject.dat&dquot;&amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/258/reject.dat&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This HEASARC table also does NOT contain the additional information on gravitationally lensed quasars and quasar pairs listed in Tables 3 and 4 of the published paper: these tables are available in electronic form at the CDS &amp;lt;a href=&dquot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/248/&dquot;&amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/VII/248/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; files table2.dat and table3.dat (sic). The present edition of this catalog contains quasars with measured redshift known prior to July 1st, 2009.</TD>
